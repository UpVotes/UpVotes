					 <h2>Here are some tips on how you can choose the best mobile app development companies for your firm:</h2>
					 
					 <h3>1)First things first – freelancer or a company</h3>

                     <p>You can be an individual looking for an app pr a company looking for an app. Depending upon your bandwidth and budget you must choose whether you need a freelancer or a company. Needless to say a company will definitely be costlier than a freelancer. However, you have chances of getting all the services from app development to app launch under one roof.</p>

                     <p>Another quick way of short listing some developers are – look for the apps you like or the kind of app you would want to benchmark your app against, and check the source and the developer name for that.</p>

                     <p>In the US market below can be the cost of apps development as per the size of the partners:</p>

                     <ul class="youlstyle">
                     <li>a. Small teams – upto $100000</li>
                     <li>b. Development agencies – upto $4,50,000</li>
                     <li>c. Well known/big agencies – $1000,000</li>
                     <li>(Hyperlink the above points to the categories) </li>
                     </ul>
					 
					 <h3>2)Strikeout the ones that do not fit the bill</h3>
					 
					 <p>There are a number of factors which we have listed below that will indicate that a particular partner is not right whether you are looking at a freelancer or a company. Watch out for those and straight away weed out the names which have these traits:</p>
					 
					 <ul class="youlstyle">
                     <li>1)They don’t have significant number of apps to showcase.</li>
                     <li>2)Even if they have – the apps haven’t got any rave reviews or even decent reviews.</li>
                     <li>3)They don’t understand your business well – brief them about your business in detail and question them to make sure they understand your business.</li>
                     <li>4)If it’s a company – make sure they are not outsourcing any of your works to another third party.</li>
                     <li>5)They are willing to work for you at a really cheap price and are willing to accept all kind of work for you – without grilling you a lot on the requirements.</li>
                     </ul>
					 
					 <h3>3)Check references</h3>
					 
					 <p>Ask for references beyond the case studies and brand logos they show you.</p>
					 
					 <p>Ask for specific person-references. It is highly unlikely that if a developer has done a great job for their client they will defy providing these</p>
					 
					 <p>If they are not comfortable giving you person specific references ask them company names and find out the person in-charge on the web – LinkedIn is a great source. You can look at designations like – Digital Manager or IT manager etc. If you get to speak to these references ask them questions like</p>
					 
					 <ul class="youlstyle">
                     <li>a.What was their project?</li>
                     <li>b.Were they responsive to iterations asked?</li>
                     <li>c.How much time did they take to finish the project?</li>
                     <li>d.If it is a company did they give you one single point of contact – a project manager?</li>
                     </ul>
					 
					 <h3>4)Ask for technical skills of the team</h3>
					 
					 <p>Check whether the team working on your project have all the required skills. You would like to check on the below factors:</p>
					 
					 <ul class="youlstyle">
					 <li>a.If they have people who have skill sets on the platform required by you (iOS, Android, Windows or all)</li>
					 <li>b.Do they have dedicated UI and UX specialists</li>
					 <li>c.Will they outsource anything out a 3rd party team</li>
					 <li>d.Will they provide after development services – branding, launch etc.</li>
					 </ul>
					 
					 <h3>5)Finally ask the right questions before signing the dotted line</h3>
					 
					 <p>Before you finalise on a company go beyond asking the basics – it’s not just about the work they do it’s also about the fact that whether they will suit your way of working or not. Don’t shy away from asking some tough questions to the partners you have shortlisted:</p>
					 
					 <ul class="youlstyle">
					 <li>a.What kind of results your previous apps have been able to achieve?</li>
					 <li>b.What will be the team size and what is the technical expertise of the person who will be in contact with you.</li>
					 <li>c.Do they have any experience in building apps in the same industry?</li>
					 <li>d.What will be the realistic time frame? What will be the plan of action if they are not able to meet the committed timeline?</li>
					 <li>e.What kind of testing and quality control approach will they take?</li>
					 </ul>
