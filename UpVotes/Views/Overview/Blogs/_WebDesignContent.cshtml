    <h3>Quality does not come cheap</h3>

    <p>Your website is the most important element of your business. If a web developer is asking too less even lesser than the industry standards it is apparent they do not have the muscle to deliver a good project or haven't done so in the past. If a web development is asking for a higher or standard rate chances are they have been delivering projects at that rate and their customers pay that to them for the quality the offer. </p>
