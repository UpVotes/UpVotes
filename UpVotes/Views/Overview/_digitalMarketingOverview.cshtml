                <p>So, now that you have built all these assets why you should look at marketing it. So, here is a simple analogy – consider you have opened a small cafe – will cooking delicious food will be enough? Won’t you go tell about your cafe to friends and family first and then to others through may be pamphlets, hoardings etc. Or at best you would at least put a banner outside to let passers-by know that there is a cafe here. Same goes with your digital assets.</p>
                <p>There are 3.4 Billion internet users globally, which is half the world’s population. We wouldn’t be exaggerating if we say that almost more than half of your customer base is also a part of this vast digital universe.</p>

                <h2>How Long Does It Take to See Digital Marketing Results?</h2>
                <p>The best thing about digital marketing is that it is measurable. So, you can almost immediately see the results of your campaigns. Though paid campaigns will show results immediately, organic efforts takes time to show the results.</p>
                <p>It takes a long term and consistent effort to build a successful digital marketing strategy and you must keep at it to see positive results.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>According to the digital marketing guru <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-long-does-take-see-digital-marketing-results-neil-patel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neil Patel</a> <em>‘’ It can take three months to even begin seeing the results of those efforts.’’</em></strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>So patience and persistence is the key when it comes to organic digital marketing efforts. But, if you are thinking you would rather go for paid campaigns and see results. That definitely is not the right way to go about it. Paid campaigns might show you some results but those will be short term and is your content game is not up to the mark you will see even those results diminishing over a period of time.</p>
                <p><strong>Here is how long it will take your paid and organic content efforts to show results</strong></p>
                <h3>Paid search (Adwards – Search marketing)</h3>
                <p>If you target the right keywords and bid competitive amount chances are you will see traffic rise almost immediately. However, to see long term effect you would have to do it continuously. And most importantly just investing money and doing the right keyword targeting will not make sure that your d shows up on top. Landing page will play a very important role in that.</p>
                <h3>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</h3>
                <p>Your SEO and paid search campaigns should be done hand in hand. While SEO is the backbone of your digital marketing efforts paid search will support it. An SEO campaign might take somewhere between 6-8 months to really show positive results, and you have to consistently keep up with the changing trends of the industry. Content marketing is an important part of your SEO initiatives.</p>
                <h3>Social media marketing</h3>
                <p>Social media might not give you leads immediately (of course that depends on the kind of campaign you are doing). However, it will boost your SEO efforts for sure. Most brands use social media as platforms to raise awareness. The number of followers you have can a be a great measurement on how your social media campaign is doing. However don’t buy followers it will only boost your ego and will not serve any real purpose. If you use it actively and generate engaging content there are less chances that your social media account will not get followers.</p>
                <h2>Do I Need a Big Budget for Digital Marketing?</h2>
                <p>
                    How much should you spend on digital marketing? This remains a difficult question to answer for most marketers.
                    <br> However, with digital marketing you can actually start with your unpaid efforts with zero-budget. Further, it really depends on the elements you choose for your digital media plan.
                </p>

                <ul class="youlstyle">
                    <li>Divide your marketing budget based on which strategies work best.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you already have a website you can set up your digital marketing channels without any investing anything much like your personal social media accounts or a blog etc.</p>
                <p>If your approach majorly encompasses inbound marketing then the good news is you can focus on creating awesome content first, if you are not planning to outsource the work you would only have to invest time behind it.</p>
                <p>For paid campaigns of course you would need to spend some money, but you can always pause a campaign if it is not working so that you don’t end up spending the entire money and then realise that the campaign did not work, unlike the traditional media.</p>
                <ul class="youlstyle">
                    <li>You need to set your marketing goals and strategy before you set your budget.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Probably the reason why this year the internet marketing spends exceeded TV spends.</p>
                <p>For easing out the confusion let’s see what are the industry trends when it comes to digital marketing</p>
                <p><img class="wp-image-771 aligncenter" title="Big Budget for Digital Marketing" src="images/Overview/digitalmarketing-img9.jpg"></p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Source: <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Marketingcharts.com</a></p>
                <p>We can see spends on Email marketing, Social media and Paid search are seeing the highest interest. However, the above chart may be good for your reference you would have to distribute these spends according to your business spends.</p>
                <p>For e.g. even though Facebook sees maximum investments when it comes to social media, you might find LinkedIn though in the expensive side works for you better.</p>
                <p>According to an emarketer survey Facebook is expected to continue its reign as king, with 90% of social media users utilizing in the platform. Instagram is expected to grow, from 32% penetration to 47% by 2020. Pinterest and Twitter will continue to have relatively low penetration, peaking at around 33% of users by 2020.</p>
                <p>Does that mean you should invest in each of these? The answer is yes and no both. If you think all these platforms are beneficial, are inline with your business, and you have deep pockets go ahead. If not then pick and choose what works best for you and work accordingly.</p>
                <p>So does that mean businesses are not spending on traditional medium at all? Of course not. According to the emarketer survey mentioned above marketers plan to spend 40% of their total marketing budget on digital media.</p>

                </ul>
