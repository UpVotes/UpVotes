                <p>Your website is an asset which you expect to drive revenue for you. Make sure the web agency you choose understands this too. They believe in a website which is geared for conversion is important.</p>
                <h4>7. They Have a multi-industry experience</h4>
                <p>Don’t make the mistake of choosing a developer who has worked only in one kind of industry, even if that is your industry. If they have worked only in your industry your website will end up looking like all others in the market. you certainly do not want that.</p>
                <h4>8. Quality does not come cheap</h4>
                <p>Your website is the most important element of your business. If a web developer is asking too less even lesser than the industry standards it is apparent they do not have the muscle to deliver a good project or haven’t done so in the past. If a web development is asking for a higher or standard rate chances are they have been delivering projects at that rate and their customers pay that to them for the quality the offer.</p>
