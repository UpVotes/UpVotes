                            <h3>Mobile app development categories</h3>
                            <p>All the apps in the app marketplace can be divided on the basis of technology and industries.</p>
                            <p><strong>Mobile apps according to technology:</strong></p>
                            <p>There are 3 different types of mobile apps basis the platforms and the technology used to build them:</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                                •Native mobile apps
                                <br> •Hybrid mobile apps
                                <br> •Web apps/ responsive websites
                            </p>
                            <h3>Native mobile apps</h3>
                            <p>Native apps as the name suggests are natives of the platforms they have been built for. Which means these apps are exclusively built for a particular platform and the same app cannot be used on a different platform, in simple words apps built for Android cannot be used on iOS or Windows or Blackberry and vice versa.</p>
                            <p>Native apps have the below advantages:</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                                -High performance
                                <br> -High speed
                                <br> -Better User Experience (UX) and UI (User Interface)
                                <br> -Have better reach compared to similar apps which are non native (Hybrid)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, native apps are on the costlier side as the platform for which it is made is limited. If you have limited budgets one have to choose between reaching out on a limited platform with a native app or building a hybrid app (which may not compare as well with native apps).
                                <br> If you have the budgets and you do choose to go for native apps take into account the time required to build a native app. As Native apps require more time, since one has to build separate apps for separate platforms.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Hybrid mobile apps</h3>
                            <p>Hybrid mobile apps are multi platform mobile apps which are build using different technologies like HTML5, CSS, Java etc. Once you build a hybrid app it can be used on various platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.).</p>
                            <p>Basically, hybrid apps are web applications with a native app wrapper. Hybrid apps are built using tools that can enable communication between web view and the native platform. These are third party tools and framework like Apache Cordova, Ionic, React Native etc.</p>
                            <p><strong>Hybrid apps are known to have below advantages</strong></p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                                -Easy to build
                                <br> -Cost efficient
                                <br> -Time efficient
                                <br> -Low maintenance
                            </p>
                            <p>Though looking at the above points one may be skewed towards building a hybrid app however, hybrid app have their own set of disadvantages like:</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                                -Low performance
                                <br> -Lower speed compared to native apps
                                <br> -Lower speed
                                <br> -Probability of design flaws – since one single app may look and operate differently on individual platforms.
                            </p>
                            <p>If your business demands building a hybrid app, do so keeping in mind the above disadvantages and making sure that the extent of these disadvantages are reduced in your app so that it does not effects user experience as much.</p>
                            <h3>Web apps/ responsive websites</h3>
                            <p>Web apps are basically responsive sites or applications that imitate the functioning of native app. Web apps run on the mobile browser. However, one of the major disadvantages of web apps is the huge memory consumption.</p>
                            <p>Also, web apps do not function well with a slow internet connection, causing a bad user experience. Given the fact that almost 89% of a users’ time is spent on mobile apps and not mobile browser it makes sense for business owners to choose between native and hybrid apps.</p>
                            <p>Besides all these apps there are apps which are also categorised as per the industries like – Utility apps (Google, Reminders Calculators etc.), Social media apps, Lifestyle apps, Games &amp; Entertainment apps, News apps, Productivity apps (Docs, Sheets, Wallet/Pay, Evernote, Wunderlust etc.)</p>
                            <p>Though, each of the platforms be native, hybrid or web apps have their own pros and cons; native apps by far are known to give the best performance. However, given your budget and time you have for taking your product to market one can choose between any one of these. Irrespective of the platform you choose to go ahead with it is important to keep in mind that apps are developed for users and user experience is something that should be one of the most critical aspect which businesses should keep in mind while developing an app.</p>
                            <h2>What are the best features of a successful mobile application?</h2>
                            <p>
                                As mentioned earlier there are millions of apps in app market place, may be hundreds or thousands in your category.
                                <br> Today’s consumers download apps fast and abandon them faster, only 36% of apps are retained after one month of downloading and almost 77% of users do not use an app 72 hours after downloading
                            </p>
                            <p>So, with so many apps vying for users’ attention what makes one app stand out over another.</p>
                            <h2>Here are top 5 features which should be considered for the success of your mobile app:</h2>

                                    <p>
                                        Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.- Steve Jobs.
                                        <br> As mentioned earlier, any app irrespective of the category or industry should be developed keeping in mind that it is meant for the end user and has to be simple and intuitive to use.
                                    </p>
                                    <strong class="side-image two">-Be present on relevant platforms</strong>
                                    <p>
                                        Android and iOS platforms cover more than 99% of the app market share</a>. Irrespective of the platform you choose to develop your app in (Native/hybrid) it makes sense to be present in both these platforms.
                                        <br> In case you plan to build a native app, build an app for the Android platform first (which dominates over 75% of the app market place) and as time and resources permit go for an iOS platform.

                            <p>According to a study almost  due to lagging loading speed of an app. Therefore irrespective of the type of app you are planning to build it is important that it loads quickly and performs impeccably on the users’ device.</p>
                            <strong class="side-image four">-Security is the key</strong>
                            <p>
                                With apps being used for almost everything in a users’ life from reminding them about their next meeting, to keeping a check on their health, shopping, banking so on and so forth; one of the major aspects that should be kept in mind is the security of your app.
                                <br> Today mobile is an important place for users to store most of their critical data from passwords of their email, social media accounts etc. therefore it is very critical for every app developer to maintain a robust security of their apps. A substandard app security can not only adversely affect the success of your app but your brand reputation too.
                            </p>
                            <strong class="side-image five">-Keeping up with market trends and latest technology</strong>
                            <p>Building a mobile app can be one time job. However, making sure to keep user engagement and user retention is an ongoing job. To make sure that you app drives high user engagement it is important to keep up with the latest technologies and updated content. Most importantly it must be integrated with social media, so that it can be shared easily and also provides ease of logging for users.</p>

                            <p>Build a blueprint of what your app will look like first. If you are an app developers get the wireframe approved by your client or management (if you are building an app for your company) before getting into design and development. If you are outsourcing app development efforts ask your mobile app development company partner to share a blue print and jointly agree upon it to have a smooth app development process through out.</p>

                            <h3>1)First things first – freelancer or a company</h3>

                            <p>Another quick way of short listing some developers are – look for the apps you like or the kind of app you would want to benchmark your app against, and check the source and the developer name for that.</p>

                            </p>
                            <h3>2)Strikeout the ones that do not fit the bill</h3>
                            <p>There are a number of factors which we have listed below that will indicate that a particular partner is not right whether you are looking at a freelancer or a company. Watch out for those and straight away weed out the names which have these traits:</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                                1)They don’t have significant number of apps to showcase.
                                <br> 2)Even if they have – the apps haven’t got any rave reviews or even decent reviews.
                                <br> 3)They don’t understand your business well – brief them about your business in detail and question them to make sure they understand your business.
                                <br> 4)If it’s a company – make sure they are not outsourcing any of your works to another third party.
                                <br> 5)They are willing to work for you at a really cheap price and are willing to accept all kind of work for you – without grilling you a lot on the requirements.
                            </p>
                            <h3>3)Check references</h3>
                            <p>
                                Ask for references beyond the case studies and brand logos they show you.
                                <br> Ask for specific person-references. It is highly unlikely that if a developer has done a great job for their client they will defy providing these references.
                            </p>
                            <p>If they are not comfortable giving you person specific references ask them company names and find out the person in-charge on the web – LinkedIn is a great source. You can look at designations like – Digital Manager or IT manager etc. If you get to speak to these references ask them questions like</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">

                            </p>

                            <h3>5)Finally ask the right questions before signing the dotted line</h3>

Don’t shy away from asking some tough questions to the partners you have shortlisted:</p>
                            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
                                a.What kind of results your previous apps have been able to achieve?
