                        <br>
                        <p>If you use off the shelf products which are available in the market, chances are your competitor too is using the same software. If you use a off-the-shelf software which is used by most of your competitor you will end up being just like them but never better than them. A customised software solution is not only tailor made for your business, it also gives you competitive advantage above your competition</p>
                        <p>Do you depend upon software to deliver a product/service to your customer? Pundits of off-the-shelf</p>
                        <p>2. Be future ready</p>

                        <h2>What are the popular types and categories of Software Development?</h2>

                        <p>Before we get into the different kinds of software development that are happening in the market, let’s understand what is a software in a simple language. A computer software or software is that part of the system which consists of various data or instructions to process certain information and complete various tasks.</p>
                        <p><strong>There are various categories of softwares that are available in the market, these are:</strong></p>

                        <p>Application software office suites, word processors, spreadsheets, etc.) - It is a small computer program that is used to perform a group of coordinated functions. For e.g. web browser, word processor etc. Application softwares made for mobile platform are known as mobile apps.</p>

                        <p>System software operating systems, device drivers, desktop environments, etc.)- These are computer softwares designed to provide a platform for other softwares. Examples of such softwares are game engines, Software as a service (SaaS), etc.</p>

                        <p>Computer programming tools: assemblers, compilers, linkers, etc.)- A programming tools or software development tools are computer programs that are used to support, debug or maintain other software programs. These tools can be combined to accomplish a particular task. Examples of such tools are source code editor, compiler, interpreter etc.</p>

                        <p><strong>The first two of these are classified for running software on computers and the last one is about developing the software in the first place.</strong></p>
                        <p>Now that we understand the various types of software, let us take a look at the different types of software development processes that happen. Software development can pan across different devices and platforms, some of the most important and popular type of software development methods are:</p>

                        <h3>1. Web Development</h3>

                        <p>Web development is one of the oldest kind of software development which developers used to work in. It refers to the development of a website. One of the reasons of the popularity of web development is the emergence of new web technologies and APIs (application Programming Interfaces)</p>
                        <h3>2. Mobile Development</h3>

                        <p>Developing applications for the mobile platform is known as mobile development or app development. The prolific growth of smartphones has resulted. Mobile is a versatile platform which has a space and possibility of every kind of app to be inculcated into this platform.</p>

                        <h3>3. Data Science</h3>

                        <p>In a world ruled by digitization, there is a data deluge happening across platforms and devices. However, the challenge remains to seek insights from these data. This kind of development work is known as data science.  This one’s quickly picking up momentum in South Africa, but is a major field overseas</p>

                        <h3>4. Application Development</h3>

                        <p>This is considered to be the real kind of programming which refers to the development of standard windows, Mac or Linux applications that can perform various tasks on desktop operating systems.</p>

                        <h3>5. Back-end Development</h3>

                        <p>Back-end development refers to the development of programs that happen at the back-end to ensure that the from-end applications are running well. Database management is an example of one such type of software development.</p>

                        <h3>6. Software Tools Development</h3>

                        <p>This kind of development is aimed at developing tools for other software developers, so that they can test their codes with. These tools also help in telling the developers if their codes are in line with industry standards.</p>

                        <h3>7. API Development</h3>

                        <p>Developers build various programs that work as building blocks for programs across different operating systems, devices and platforms. These help in laying the foundation of basic procedures of software development.</p>

                        <h3>8. Embedded Systems Development</h3>

                        <p>With the raging popularity of IoT or Internet Of Things, everything is getting connected. With these the embedded app development has also boomed.</p>

                        <h3>9. Security Software Development</h3>

                        <p>Hacking or developing software's for security purposes. These software's help in keeping check at the cyber security of the company’s digital assets.</p>

                        <h3>10. Cloud Computing</h3>

                        <p>Earlier most enterprises relied on the internal storage of their data and file. But now a day's developers use cloud platform to store data and booked into the website. It eliminates the need of having a strong internal storage system at your end, especially if you are a smaller business. Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and others, that powers your webmail, OneDrive storage, and GitHub, etc. are the examples of such services.</p>

                        <h2>What are the characteristics of a software development company?</h2>

                        <p>If you have a custom software development idea, it is obvious that you want to look at a software development partner, who can understand and implement the custom software for your organization.</p>

                        </ul>

                        <h2>Process of software development.</h2>
                        <p>A software process development is the process and steps involved in production of the software. This process is also called as software methodology. The various activities involved in the process of software development can be - design and development from the start, or modifying and improvising an already available system.</p>
                        <p><strong>Below are the various steps that are involved in overall software development from the scratch:</strong></p>

                        <ul class="youlstyle">
                            <strong>Below are the various steps that are involved in overall software development from the scratch:</strong>

                            <li>Specification of the software also known as requirement engineering: This step involved defining the major functionalities of the software and the limitations around it.</li>

                            <li>Design and implementation: This is the step where the software is designed and finalised and the programming of the software starts.</li>

                            <li>Verification and Validation of the software: In this step it is validated and verified that the software developed is in confirmation to the software specifications agreed upon in the first stage and it works according to the expectations.</li>

                            <li>Maintenance of the software also known as software evolution: In this stage the developed software is taken to the market and depending on the response or the market requirements it is modified or evolved further.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The above steps are an overview of the software development process. However, at a detailed level there are also sub activities that are a part of the software development process under each of these steps like requirement validation, architectural design, unit testing, configuration and change management, quality assurance and testing, project management, user experience testing so on and so forth.</p>

                        <p><strong>Further, a software development process have more inclusions beyond the above mentioned activities. These inclusions are also known as process description, which involves:</strong></p>

                        <ul class="youlstyle">
                            <strong>Products:</strong>
                            
                            <li>These are the outcomes of an activity, for instance, these can be the resulting product coming out of an architectural design which can be a model for the software architecture.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="youlstyle">
                            <strong>Roles:</strong>
                            
                            <li>Defining the roles and the work of the human resources involved in the implementation of the project for e.g. the project manager, programmer, account manager, etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="youlstyle">
                            <strong>Defining the conditions before and after the project completion: </strong>
                            
                            <li>These are the conditions that are agreed upon beforehand for the project to be considered as being completed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Developing a software is not an easy job, the entire process is complex with a lot of moving parts involved. Depending on the business requirement the complexity of the process is defined. Every software development process is unique and is defined by the business needs.</p>

                        <p>There are various models that businesses follow for the software development. Every process model can be extended, modified and customised according to the need of a particular organisation.</p>

                        <h3>Some of these processes or methodologies are also known as Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</h3>

                        <h2>Some of these processes or methodologies are also known as Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</h2>

                        <h3>1. Waterfall Model:</h3>

                        <p>Web development can be an extremely gruelling process if not dealt with in a systematic manner. Most people think that creating a design and then coding is all that is required to finish a web development process. Designing and coding may be important aspects of website development. However, that is not all. There are many more steps towards successfully creating a website.</p>

                        <img src="images/Overview/image1-software.jpg" alt="Waterfall Model">

                        <h3>2. Prototyping Model:</h3>

                        <p>It is a model where a basic prototype or a part of the system is developed in very short time, to understand and visualise customer requirement. This kind of model is useful when the customer and the software developer is not very sure of the requirements from the software they are developing. It is also useful in clarifying the feasibility of a software design.</p>

                        <img src="images/Overview/image2-software.jpg" alt="Prototyping Model">

                        <h3>3. Incremental Development:</h3>

                        <p>This is a process, where a an initial development and implementation of a software model is done. Post which it is opened for user feedback, depending on the feedback the model is further modified and improved. This process evolves as per the user feedback.</p>

                        <img src="images/Overview/image3-software.jpg" alt="Incremental Development" width="650" height="350">

                        <h3>4. Spiral Model</h3>

                        <p>This kind of software development method is implemented in loops. It has features of both waterfall and prototyping models. Each loop or spiral represents a specific phase in this model. While the first phase can be about system feasibility the next can be about requirement design, further system design, so on and so forth.</p>

                        <img src="images/Overview/image4-software.jpg" alt="Spiral Model">

                        <h3>5. Iterative Development</h3>

                        <p>This kind of software development is aimed at developing the software in bits and pieces, that is developing the system by building the a bit of all the features, across every component. A basis product is developed according to the initial scope. This version with limited features is them released in the market to understand the market and gage initial customer reaction.</p>

                        <center><img src="images/Overview/image5-software.jpg" alt="Spiral Model"></center>

                        <h3>6. Agile Model:</h3>

                        <p>It is a dynamic and flexible method which can be adapted and modified according to various circumstances. These include various software development models grouped together based on iterative and incremental approach. In this kind of a model new releases are done to the software incrementally and released in every few weeks. There are a various Agile methods available like: Scrum, Crystal, Agile Modeling (AM), Extreme Programming (XP), etc. </p>

                        <h3>7. Reuse-oriented Software Engineering</h3>

                        <p>In this model an existing design or code is reused, if the requirement is similar to the ones that have been implemented earlier. This old version of code is reused and modified to fit into the new requirements and is further tested, before the software release.</p>

They are ready to integrate their learnings as you move ahead in the software development process and they are also open to collaborative approach. Learning, growing and implementing process along with you at every step. Before you finalise on them make sure you know and agree with the communication process that will be followed between you and the software development partner over the course of the development process.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="youlstyle">
                            <h3>3. Choose a partner who disagrees with you enough</h3>
                            
                            <li>In real life the friends we appreciate the most are the ones who course correct us in our ways and call out our wrongdoings and shortcomings and help us become a better person. You should follow the same principal while choosing a software development firm for your organisation. You do not want an ‘Yes-man’ in this area. You are not an expert in the domain hence you would rely more on the software development partner to do the best for you. In this scenario if you are choosing a development partner who agrees with you in each and everything, is a sign of their incapability of their disinterest in your project. Both of these are a extremely detrimental to the success of your project.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="youlstyle">
                            <h3>4. Choose a software development firm which is similar to you:</h3>
                            
                            <li>While choosing a software development partner make sure you are not choosing a company which is way bigger than you, no matter howsoever, attractive and glamorous that prospect seems to you. There are higher chances that a firm way bigger than your size will have projects which are large in size, larger than yours. It is obvious that then you do not become a priority for such firms, you would definitely want to avoid a situation like that. Similarly a firm way smaller than you might not have enough resources and scale to implement your project in time and give a quality output as well.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="youlstyle">
                            <h3>5. Choose the ones who know their job well</h3>
                            
                            <li>This might seem like obvious that you would want to choose a development partner, who looks to be an expert in their job. However, the way you go about choosing them is important. More often you would get impressed if they show you that they are experts on every technology and language in the world, but, that is an extremely risky way to go about it. If they say they are experts in everything, chances are they are the kind ‘jack of all trades, master in none’’, especially if they are not a very big organisation, you would want to stay away from such firms.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>You are not just choosing a software development firm for your organisation, but a ‘software development partner, which is going to work with you for a long run and very closely. Therefore, it becomes very crucial to choose a software development partner whose work culture is in line with your work environment. This will ensure a harmonious development and completion of the project throughout. A harmonious development process will ensure that your development process is not just seamless and without much conflicts and stress free, but you and the software development partner are always in sync. This will ensure that your project gets completed in time and successfully.</li>
