What does it mean for the businesses in across the globe? The implications are simple, having a digital presence is more than crucial for businesses today.</p>
                <p>What does a digital presence mean? Many businesses overlook the importance of having a strong digital presence, but in a world which is increasingly moving from a digital-only to digital-first world not having a digital presence can be hugely detrimental for businesses in today’s world. So, while embarking towards a digital journey, it is important to have minimum digital assets and a website is most important part of this digital jigsaw. If you are still thinking how and why a website is the most important step towards a successful digital journey, here are few compelling reasons you must read through to understand the importance of a well designed website:</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">1) Ensure your business is present where your customers are:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Today most customers look for, research and review a product online. If your business is not read on there are high chances that you would miss reaching out to these customers.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">2) Increase visibility:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">If your business is online, you have higher chances of reaching out to a much wider population even outside of few kilometres of your geographical destination.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">3) Build credibility:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Today’s customers rely on the web to find out more information about your business. In most cases your website is the first impression your customers will have about your business.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">4) Stay ahead of your customer:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">A SEO friendly website means you appear before your competitors when customers are searching for products or services related to your business. Which means customers see you first, they reach out to you first.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">5) Online catalogue and services:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">A website will ensure that you have a detailed version of the services your business offer online and it reaches out to your customers regardless of where they are. How many times it has happened that your sales team did not have a brochure or a detailed document which defines your services to the client. A website eliminates the need of having a hard copy brochure all the time with them. As the website becomes an always accessible virtual business catalogue for your business.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">6) Added revenue:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Irrespective of which business you operate in, your website serves as another sales channel for your business. If you are a retail store, your website is an extended branch of your store, if you are an restaurant or a small cafe, your website will help you get more orders, if you are a B2B business your website will help you generate more enquiry. Even if you are an individual and with your own powerful online presence can help you earn more money through ads which appear on your website.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">7) Optimise your advertising cost:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unlike what most businesses think, a well designed and SEO friendly website will make serve as a promotional and communication channel for your brand. If done well you would need to spend less through other advertising channels, which are most of the times more expensive than having a website.</p>
                <p><strong style="font-size:18px;color:#60c1d9">8) Connect with your customers:</strong></p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your website is an excellent medium to reach out to your customers and solve their queries and address their grievances as well. It also reduces the amount of investment you would need to do on customer care and support. One such example is Amazon’s customer care and support who are reachable across various online channels – email, chat bots etc.</p>

                <p>Before talking about the best programming languages in the world let’s understand what is meant by website programming languages. A programming language is the one which is used to manage and control different actions of a website. These languages are drafted and designed in such a way so that it can communicate and give instructions to a system and perform various functions and actions on the system.</p>
                <p>A programming language has 2 different kinds of components – the semantics and the syntax. While syntax is the form or the type, semantics define or are the meaning of these type or form. There are numerous programming languages around the world, and each of these languages are unique.

                <p></p>
                <p><strong>The various features of a programming language is known as its traits. Every programming language has three traits which are as follows:</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Abstractions</strong> – These are the rules that help in defining or marking the data structures and manipulate the way the commands on the system are executed.</p>
                <p><strong>Function and target</strong> – As a programming language is used, developers have to do a some program writing work on their own as well. Further, the help of computer system is also required to perform the computation work and to control the algorithms. Further, the computer also monitors or some external devices connected to it like printer, robots, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Expressive power</strong> – Most programming languages are classified by the computations that these languages are able to express. This trait of the programming languages are one of the most important traits of the programming languages.</p>
                <p>Various factors which should be considered while choosing a programming language are:</p>
                <ul class="youlstyle">
                    <li>Platform on which the program will run on.</li>
                    <li>The language you choose must be matched with your domain.</li>
                    <li>The language you choose must be flexible so that more programs can be added to the language.</li>
                    <li>Depending on your project size you should choose a language which can support a large or small project.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Features for Web Application Development:</h2>
                <p>The overall website development process can be quite overwhelming. However, getting it right in terms of UI (user interface), UX (user experience), functions, SEO, etc. is very crucial. Here are some of the most important features which developers should be kept in mind while developing a website:</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1) Getting the right structure:</strong></p>
                <p>One of the most important factors while developing a website is the structure. While choosing an structure ensure that it is in line with your business. If you are in a serious B2B business it is important to make sure your structure is not quirky or if you are a fashion brand make sure your map defines that.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2) Fine roadmap</strong></p>
                <p>It is not enough to have a nice looking website, you have to make sure that the website is also functional and useful for your visitors. Before you get into development of your website, it is important to map how exactly your website will function. For doing that it is important to make a mock up design or a wireframe of the website is important. Also, the Google bot crawls through the content and the structure of the website to rank it into its search engine page. Therefore, it is important to have a well designed site structure in place.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3) Ensure your website clearly represent important business information</strong></p>
                <p>Most businesses develop website which are nice to look at, but do not convey about the services offered by the enterprise easily. For e.g. while most websites have giant ‘about us’ page they lack in relevant content on the services page. They will dedicate an entire page for the history of the company, they will forget about adding important informational resources on the page. It is important that depending on the business you gear up your website to provide the most relevant and important information about your business easily to the consumer.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4) Easy to find contact us page</strong></p>

                <h2>Example: The Perfect Contact page (For Freelancers, Agencies, and Creative Entrepreneurs)</h2>
                <p></p>
                <center><img src="images/Overview/development-img2.jpg" alt="The Perfect Contact page (For Freelancers, Agencies, and Creative Entrepreneurs)" style="width:80%;"> </center>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Infographic source: <a href="https://www.business2community.com/infographics/create-perfect-contact-page-infographic-0821918#!bKmsBA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Business2community.com</a></p>
                <p>Most websites have a structure where the contact us information is not easily accessible. Now consumers who want to contact you directly and land on your website, it becomes extremely important to gear up your website so that these consumers can easily do so. Besides, it leaves a very bad impression about your business if you make it complex to contact you. It seems like you are not interested in the visitor. If you show you customers that you are not interested in them, they would also not be interested in your business. Hence make the contact information of your website easy to find. Further, also ensure that you have relevant information available on your website like email, phone no. address etc. Some enterprises also add number of their sales representatives on the website. Anyway, if you do not want to add phone numbers, make sure you do add basic relevant information on the website. Further, also ensure that you do not have copious contact us form on your website.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5) Easy navigation</strong></p>
                <p>It is important that you put yourself in the shoes of the visitor who is coming to your site. How would you want to navigate on a website, what are the most important things you would want to find on the website upfront. For eg. you would want to easily find out the services, contact information, FAQs etc. If the basic information is not accessible easily it can put off your customers. To make a website which is easily navigable, it is important to make a persona of your user who will come on the website and then create a design of your website.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6) Security</strong></p>
                <p>With the increasing number of website users across the worldwide, the usage of internet has also grown immensely. However, the growing popularity of internet has also given rise to the number of security risks as well. Make sure that the security measures of your website is robust. Make sure you have a proper SSL certificate on your website, especially if you are selling something online it is more than important to ensure stringent security measures on your website.</p>

                <h2>Process of Web Development</h2>
                <p>Web development can be an extremely gruelling process if not dealt with in a systematic manner.

                    <strong>4) Understand their expertise:</strong>
                    
                    <li>You have a certain vision for your website, make sure that the web development agency you are looking for has expertise to work on your website according to your vision.               Further, you will also have to look if they have the basic expertise to take up your website development project. Also, what kind of websites they have developed in the past               have they work on a similar business website like yours etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="youlstyle">
                    <strong>5) Their work culture:</strong>
                    
                    <li>Your website development partner will work with you day and night to develop your website. They will be the extended part of your enterprise much like your employees or               the human resources of your company. Hence it is important that their work culture is in line with yours to make sure that the entire business development process happens               harmoniously.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="youlstyle">
                    <strong>6) Understand their communication process:</strong>
                    
                    <li>It is important what are the communication channels the website development agency will use to communicate with your enterprise. Will there be a relationship manager or               will you be interacting with the development team directly? How do they go about setting up job status meetings? Will there be scrum meeting daily, weekly etc. If you are               working with offshore teams how would they work around the different time gaps. Will you be allotted an offshore teams etc. It is important to understand all these things to               ensure a smooth completion of the project.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul class="youlstyle">
                    <strong>7) Understand the budgets:</strong>
                    
                    <li>
                        Many businesses, mostly the small and medium enterprises choose to go with developers who charge them less. And, that is a big mistake. We can’t stress enough about how               important your website is for your business. Going with a developer who charges very less means that either they are new to the business and their market value is thus less,               or they don’t have enough expertise hence their market value is less.<br>
                        So, when you are choosing a website developer who is way cheaper than even the market standards, you are putting your business to a big risk. By choosing such a partner there               are high chances that your project will be miffed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Website development is an area where you get exactly what you pay for. However, but that doesn’t mean that you have to pay through your nose to get a website developed.               Understand what are the market rates, ask friends who have got a website developed on how much they have paid, then understand how much can you spend on a website. Basis all                these factors go about looking a website development agency. Make sure you don’t pay too less, or too much, you pay just the right amount to get the right website.</li>
