                                            <h1>Trends and Prediction of Digital Marketing 2020</h1>

                                            <p>It doesn’t matter what your industry is, or what products and services you offer - digital marketing trends cannot be ignored. Not so long ago, companies needed little more than a website and a Facebook page, but now, the digital landscape is evolving so quickly that it’s hard to keep up.</p>

                                            <p>By now, there aren’t too many successful businesses that don’t have an online presence. In 2020, new technologies and tools will come to the fore, forcing marketers to adapt in order to keep their organizations at the top.</p>
											
											<p>If you don’t adapt, you’ll surely be left behind. Read on to discover the digital marketing trends to be ready for in 2020.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend1. Advertising for Voice Searches</h2>
											
											<p>Voice search engines are in almost all of our homes via Amazon’s Alexa and Echo, Google’s Home and Assistant, Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana. In 2018 alone, more than <a ahref="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/04/10/voice-search-statistics-2018">1 billion voice searches</a> were carried out every month. And it is predicted that by 2020, 30% of navigation sessions will be conducted without a screen.</p>
											
											<p>Marketers  are  beginning  to  recognize  the  power  of  voice  searches  and  are  continuing  to  evolve  their  marketing  practices  to  position  well  for  voice  searches. Using a conversational tone in your written content (think words like what, when, how, who) will help maximize voice searches SEO.</p>
											
											<p>You can establish a unique advertising brand voice that will encourage listeners to immediately recognize your brand. Headspace has mastered this strategy, using the voice of Andy Puddicombe, the co-founder, in his ads and app.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend2. Mobile Advertising Continues to Increase</h2>
											
											<p>An  estimated  $93  billion  dollars  were  invested  in  mobile  ads  in  2019.  This  means $20 billion more were invested in mobile than in television. Mobile advertising has already reached a whopping <a ahref="https://www.statista.com/outlook/216/100/digital-advertising/worldwide">63% of total spending on digital advertising</a>.  Companies  will  be  allocating  significantly  more  resources towards  creating  ads  for  mobile  platforms.  This  includes  immersive  360º  content, vertical videos, and video content with fewer breaks.</p
											
											<h2>#Trend3. Shoppable Advertising</h2>
											
											<p>Social networks have become an integral part of digital marketing, especially in the retail industry. Naturally, the next logical step is the ability to shop on them.</p>
											
											<p>It is an excellent opportunity for e-commerces and brands, and many already use this function on Instagram,  since business accounts can posts photos that allow consumers to shop directly from the posts.</p>
											
											<p>We predict that this will become a reality on the other social platforms. On Instagram and Facebook, you can label the products of your store or catalog in photos and videos. When people see your tagged products in posts, they can click on those tags and then buy them. It is important to ensure that you have added the products to your Facebook/Instagram store.</p>
											
											<p>You can tag a maximum of 30 items. We recommend that you only label products that appear in your photos and videos so that the posts are still relevant to your customers. </p>
											
											<h2>#Trend4. Virtual and Augmented Reality</h2>
											
											<p>In  recent  years,  both  augmented  reality  and  virtual  reality  have  become  massively  popular  and  are  emerging  as  one  of  the  great  trends  in  digital  marketing.</p>
											
											<p>In 2020, we expect that augmented reality will end up being more popular than virtual reality.</p>
											
											<p>Several  companies  have  already  started  using  augmented  reality. <a href="https://www.ikea.com/au/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/say-hej-to-ikea-place-pub1f8af050">Ikea  launched its app</a>, Ikea Place, which allows you to “test” how different furniture or objects would look in your home.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend5. Interactive Content</h2>
											
											<p>Buyers are constantly on the hunt for new experiences and they want more interactivity. In fact, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/91-audiences-prefer-visual-content-over-traditional-formats-breiter/">91% of consumers prefer visual and interactive content over traditional formats</a>, according to the Content Preferences Survey. This is because:</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Interactive content is different and new, so it stands out above the others</li>
                                                <li>This type of content keeps visitors on the page longer</li>
                                                <li>Is has a high virality potential, and increases brand awareness</li>
                                                <li>It  generates  more  engagement  because  users  enjoy  it  more  than  other  content</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend6. Adverting Games</h2>
											
											<p>Game Advertisements, or Advergames, are a new marketing and communication tool centered around quick video games. They can be fully adapted to your brand, or can just feature your brand subtly. The goal of advergames is not just to sell your product or brand, but to entertain the user. This method is a unique way to advertise your product or brand, and it helps to generate loyalty with the consumer.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trends7. Integrated Campaigns</h2>
											
											<p>Integrated  campaigns  use  multiple  forms  of  deployment  in  a  single  campaign. For example, a video can be the center of a campaign that also uses a website, a digital book, digital radio or podcasting ads, and a social media ad campaign.</p>
											
											<p><Strong>You can deploy multiple integrated marketing actions, using a single piece of content.</strong></p>
											
											<p>An example is <a href="https://serialify.com/en/">Serialify,</a> an app that offers new ways to interact with live series. This is a product trend that many companies are beginning to hop on. Serialify is still in its beginning phases, and it will be interesting to analyze its development throughout 2020.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend7. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)</h2>
											
											<p>This inbound marketing trend is based on improving the ability to encourage customers or leads to perform a specific action. The CRO is closely linked to data-based marketing, as it uses the analysis of what is happening to determine how to improve metrics. The CRO helps identify and solve possible critical points and conversion problems on a website. The objective is to <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/increase-your-conversion-rate/">improve the conversion rate</a> by introducing a series of simple changes in the key locations.</p>
											
											<H2>Trends in SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING</H2>
											
											<P>Social networks are probably the most widely used platforms today by market-ers and advertisers due to the ability to access such large communities and potential audiences.</P>
											
											<h2>#Trend8. Transparency of Data on Facebook</h2>
											
											<p>In an effort to resume their commitment to transparency about the storage and sharing of user information, Facebook is expanding their “Why am I seeing this?” feature. Now, if a user clicks on this button now, they will see a variety of information:</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Why they are viewing a particular promoted post (for example, because it comes from a group they joined)</li>
                                                <li>The information that has the greatest influence on the order of the posts</li>
                                                <li>Shortcuts to personalization settings, such as “View First” or “Unfollow”</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<p>By clicking on “Why am I seeing this?” in an ad, the user will be able to see infor-mation about basic demographic details, interests, visits to websites, and data such as when the advertiser uploaded the information or if the brand worked with an agency. In this way, the network aspires to create more transparent advertising.</p>
											
											<p>Activity Outside of Facebook: Although this functionality already existed, it received some important updates in late August 2019. In this section, you can find third-party websites and apps that collect information via pixels . It also now allows users to erase their history or not allow Facebook to use it to personalize the advertising displayed by Facebook, Instagram and Mes-senger.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend9. Messaging services</h2>
											
											<p>Facebook  has  focused  on  improving  messaging  services  for  companies  through its social networks Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The goal is that brands can offer better communication and customer service through these  three  applications,  since  it’s  estimated  that  poor  customer  service  is  responsible for losing $75 million a year.</p>
											
											<p>We can already find examples of large companies using these messaging platforms  as  their  main  communication  system.  For  example,  Vodafone  Germany already manages 62% of its customer service conversations through WhatsApp.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend10. Messaging services</h2>
											
											<p>Following its parent company’s lead, Instagram is also focusing on increasing transparency. Some of these actions include:</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>The removal of the “followed” section, where users could view the activity of the other users they followed.</li>
                                                <li>Conducting tests in which the number of likes a post received was hidden from  followers.  Users  could  still  see  how  many  likes  their  own  posts  received, the number was just no longer publicly displayed. These tests have occurred in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States.</li>
                                                <li>Removing basic functions (follow, like, comment) of detected fraudulent use. Some actions that can be seen as fraudulent use include using automation to buy followers, bots to follow/unfollow, excessive use of hashtags, and an excessive number of comments.</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend11. Threads: The New Instagram App</h2>
											
											<p>Threads is an app from Instagram that allows users to communicate and share images with your Close Friends lists. But it goes way beyond that. As soon as you open the application, the camera is automatically turned on  so  that  users  can  instantly  take  a  picture  or  video  and  share  it.  Users  can only share with their predetermined Close Friends list, a list they can make on Instagram or on Threads. They will then receive the photo or video as a private message on Instagram (even if they don’t have Threads). For now, you can only send photos or videos taken in the moment, not from the gallery.</p>
											
											<p>There  has  been  a  bit  of  controversy  around  the  app  due  to  its  “automatic  tracking” of users’ activities at every moment. User’s status updates will be created based on their geographic location. Therefore you will know if the person you are following is at work, the gym, home, etc.</p>
											
											<p>The  app  is  now  available  for  free  for  IOS  and  Android.  You  must  have  an  Instagram account to use it.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend12. Branded Content on Facebook and Instagram</h2>
											
											<p>Branded content as we currently know it is going to change in 2020. With the new branded content feature on Facebook and Instagram, any content posted by an influencer will be labeled by a mark, allowing users to clearly understand the relationship between the influencer and the brand. Branded content can also be promoted, but since there is now an established relationship, the brand can carry out the promotion even if the content was published on the influencer’s networks. Another advance that we know is coming for next year is the ability to directly shop and buy a brand’s product from an influencer’s post.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend13. Augmented Reality in Facebook Ads</h2>
											
											<p>This function is still in the testing phase, but we can anticipate to see the first results in early 2020. An example of an AR ad could be “trying” out a product using the camera feature. This form of advertising will open up a whole new world of possibilities!</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend14. Purchasing of Advertising Spaces in Videos on Facebook</h2>
											
											<p>At Facebook’s Agency Day in Madrid, it was clear that video is king. In 2019, the display time of videos increased by 14x, prompting Facebook to invest a large number of resources into this format. In 2020 they will begin to carry out beta tests for the purchasing of video advertising  spaces,  in  the  style  of  conventional  media.  You  can  buy  a  single ad space or reservation buying. Advertisers will be able to buy space in certain content (such as videos of a specific program) or by category of  content  (for  example,  fashion  videos.)  For  markers  who  advertise  on  Facebook, this option allows an improvement in the relationship with their audience, not only through segmentation but through the content itself. </p>
											
											<h2>#Trend15. New locations for Facebook and Instagram Ads</h2>
											
											<p>In 2020 advertisers will have more options for ad placement, since two new ad spaces were added on Facebook and Instagram in 2019</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>On Facebook, ads can now show up in Facebook Search.</li>
                                                <li>On Instagram, ads can now show in the Explore tab, however, this is only limited to organic content.</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<p>Currently, neither location can be used exclusively for ads. They must be used with other Feed spaces. It will be interesting to see how this develops in the coming months.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend16. Integration of Talent Insights on LinkedIn</h2>
											
											<p>LinkedIn  has  645  million  users  in  more  than  200  countries.  At  their  annual  conference LinkedIn Talent Connect, they introduced the integration of Talent Insights. This information product will feature data on 20 million companies and more than 20 million job postings, with a renewed experience in LinkedIn Recruiter & Jobs.Thus, when you click on the Talent Insights Report tab in Recruiter & Jobs, the Talent Insights market data will appear. This became available in the late fall of 2019.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend17. Recruiter: The New LinkedIn App</h2>
											
											<p>The new LinkedIn app, Recruiter, can send notifications in real-time when a job seeker responds to a message you sent. This new app also incorporates a revamped candidate search experience, with new filters and keywords. Recruiters can now review candidate profiles or add them to existing projects, all from their phones. They can also review lists of recommended candidates made up of those they’ve decided to save, hide, or contact.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend18. Improved Engagement Features on LinkedIn</h2>
											
											<p>1. Tag other users in uploaded photos: Since mid-2019, LinkedIn users have had the ability to tag their contacts, or even other users whom they are not directly  connected  with,  in  uploaded  photos.  This  helps  to  increase  the  scope of the post. There is a limit of 30 tags per photo.</p>
											
											<p>2. React in various ways to posts: Clearly inspired by Facebook, LinkedIn now allows users to react with 5 different emojis: like, celebrate, love, insightful, or curious. This is great news for companies that do content marketing on LinkedIn, as it will allow them to more accurately measure the impact of their posts on users.</p>
											
											<p>3. Send  videos  through  private  message:  According  to  LinkedIn,  videos  generate 20 times more interest and shares than any other type of post. In addition to already being able to post public videos, users can now send videos privately through private messages.</p>
											
											<p>4. Improve the usability of the app: LinkedIn has developed a more usable mobile  application,  making  it  easier  for  users  to  post  from  the  app.  To  expedite this process, a banner has been incorporated into the bottom of the screen with a “+” icon in the center position, a design clearly inspired by Instagram.</p>
											
											<p>5. Improve  visibility  on  group  and  hashtag  posts:  Another  improvement  in  LinkedIn’s  usability  has  been  the  increased  visibility  of  posts  from  groups and hashtags that a user follows. Previously they used to be in the background, but now they are more accessible with just one click. In this way, users can access information of interest easier, which in theory should contribute to increasing the time they spend on the platform.</p>
											
											<p>6. Share  professional  documents:  Since  LinkedIn’s  inception,  users  have  been asking for ways to share presentations and professional documents. The time has finally come! Users can now share documents, PowerPoint presentations, or PDFs, both on their page and in their groups.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend19. LinkedIn Live</h2>
											
											<p>After the success of Live Video on Facebook and Instagram, LinkedIn has also developed real-time video functionality. According to Pete Davis, the director of product management at LinkedIn, it was the most requested and anticipated feature of the platform. It  was  launched  in  early  2019  in  the  United  States  and  is  still  in  the  testing  phase. We estimate that by 2020 it will be available for all pages and accounts. </p>
											
											<h2>#Trend20.  Increased  Segmentation  Tools  for  LinkedIn  Ads</h2>
											
											<p>LinkedIn is the perfect platform for B2B advertisers, as it allows them to reach users within a professional environment. Today, it has exclusive segmentation tools, related to their users’ experience and professional interests. As seen in the October 2019 update, they added advanced segmentation tools that  allow  Boolean  logic  to  create  more  accurate  and  relevant  audiences.  Additionally, they are investing time and resources in making this tool more powerful, and we expect to see it frequently in 2020. </p>
											
											<h2>#Trend21. Advertising on Pinterest</h2>
											
											<p>In March 2019 we saw one of the biggest news in social media advertising of recent times: Pinterest Ads arrived in Spain! Such ads have been available for years in the United States, and since last year in France. Because of the particularities of the social network, advertising on Pinterest has  more  in  common  with  SEM  than  with  traditional  social  ads.  And  as  always, when a new platform appears, it’s up to marketers to investigate how it works and how we can apply it to our brands.</p>
											
											<h2>Trends in Video Marketing</h2>
											
											<strong>Video Marketing</strong>
											
											<p>Video has revolutionized the way we consume content. It illustrates information in a much more interactive, visual, and entertaining way, making information much  more  digestible  and  engaging  for  the  user.  Additionally,  videos  are  a  natural  storytelling  format,  and  they  are  more  effective  for  persuasion  and  advertising.</p>
											
											<p>Video is clearly millennials’ favorite form of content. According to a Hubspot study,  96%  of  consumers  aged  between  18-34  watch  videos  several  times  throughout the week, and 75% of millennials watch at least one daily video.</p>
											
											<p>The  same  Hubspot  study  also  found  that  videos  are  helping  with  brand  engagement and sales. Videos are influencing consumer buying decisions. In fact, 64% of consumers claim that marketing videos have had weight in their purchasing decisions. </p>
											
											<strong>Some interesting facts about videos:</strong>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>More than 8 billion videos are viewed on Facebook every day.</li>
                                                <li>The videos ads on Instagram Stories can increase the impact of ads, purchase intent, message association, and CTR.</li>
												<li>Sponsored videos on Instagram generate 3x more comments than sponsored photos.</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend22. Live streaming</h2>
											
											<p>Live  videos  allow  users  to  feel  like  they  are  directly  interacting  with  the  person  or  brand  hosting  the  video.  This  feeling  of  closeness  encourages  engagement as they expect their questions or comments to be answered in real time.</p>
											
											<strong>Companies can use live videos to publicize:</strong>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>New products</li>
                                                <li>Demonstrate products</li>
												<li>Webinars</li>
												<li>Q&A Sessions</li>
												<li>Interviews</li>
												<li>Live Visits</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<p>Additionally, it is a simple and free format that does not require editing or post-production work.More social platforms and networks now support live video streaming, like Instagram Live, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, and most recently, LinkedIn.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend23. Video Podcast</h2>
											
											<p>A  video  podcast,  or  video  cast,  is  simply  a  podcast  that  is  also  recorded  on  video. Video podcasts allow listeners to see what happens during the recording of the show and give a face to the voices they hear. This format creates a new level of closeness to the brand, and it allows your audience to better connect with the hosts.</p>
											
											<p>In addition, it is a way to spread out content. For example, in addition to the podcast being hosted as normal, you can also post the transcription on your blog, the video on your YouTube account, and short video clips on your social media. Video podcasts allow the medium to exist in more than just one field. </p>
											
											<h2>#Trend24. Video E-Learning</h2>
											
											<p>It can be argued that video tutorials and DIY videos are the origin of the video boom we’re in now. Tutorials and explanatory videos are highly sought after content, which can position your brand as an expert, while giving value to your users. They can take several forms, from user generated content posted to YouTube, or professional eLearning videos posted by your company to sites like Skillshare or Udemy.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend25. 360º Virtual Reality</h2>
											
											<p>360 degree videos are videos like no other. They let users consume content in an immersive, interactive, and real way. It is increasingly being used in innovative video marketing strategies and we suspect it will only continue to grow.</p>
											
											<p>These types of videos are especially interesting for travel and event brands. National Geographic is an example of a brand who is successfully using this video format.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend26. Growth of Augmented Reality Campaigns</h2>
											
											<p>Augmented  reality  has  been  around  for  a  few  years  now,  making  it  more  accessible  for  marketers  to  use  in  their  social  media  video  campaigns.  Campaigns using augmented reality are immersive and interactive, leading to an improved user experience and a higher CTR. </p>
											
											<p>Additionally,   augmented   reality   videos   can   be   especially   useful   for   companies in the retail space, because customers can virtually “try” products. For example, using augmented reality a customer can see how a new pair of glasses would fit their face, or how a new sofa would look in their living room.<p>
											
											<h2>#Trends27. Video Advertising Continues to Grow(Video Ads)</h2>
											
											<p>Video ads are a win-win, since not only are they cheap to make but they also generate more engagement than photos alone. This means we can expect to see more companies incorporate video ads into their marketing plans, as well as post on more video-oriented platforms.</p>
											
											<p>Particularly, Gen Z is a big fan of video advertisements. They represent almost a third of the world’s population and consume 68 videos on average per day.</p>
											
											<p>Digital  video  advertising  has  grown  during  2019.  In  fact,  advertisers  are  expected to invest $20 billion in mobile video, an investment that has increased considerably if we compare the figures with 2015, which were around $2 billion.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend28. Greater  Commitment  to  the  UGC  (User  Generated Content)</h2>
											
											<p>Users tend to rely more on the opinions of other users than on the brands themselves. This means brands should encourage their fans and audiences to  produce  content  and  generate  engagement  within  the  brand’s  own  communities.  UGC  is  beneficial  because  its  trustworthy  and  does  not involve any type of investment. According to Adweek, 76% of users prefer to rely more on content shared by other customers than brands.</p>
											
											<strong>Some UGC tips:</strong>
											
											<p>When you find valuable content generated by users, share it on social networks. This will increase your visibility and enhance engagement.• “Unboxing”  and  “review”  videos  are  some  of  the  best  videos  for  your  products, since they provide an objective and trustworthy evaluation to potential customers who are likely considering buying your product.</p>
											
											<p>A great example is Toyota, who increased consumer participation by 440% with UGC. </p>
											
											<h2>#Trend29. 3D Photo Advertising Applications</h2>
											
											<p>In 2019, Facebook introduced a feature that allows users to post 3D photos on their feeds. This content is easy to create and very funny, providing a fun new medium for advertisers.</p>
											
											<p>Right now, 3D photos are a general trend. We expect that they will evolve into a digital video advertising trend in 2020. In fact, many companies have already started to try them.</p>
											
											<p>These ads are not limited to Facebook. Using the same technology, marketing specialists have developed a quick and easy way for advertisers to also recreate the 3D photos.</p>
											
											<h2>Trends in Email Marketing</h2>
											
											<Strong>Email Marketing</strong>
											
											<p>Email marketing is one of the most traditional forms of marketing, but that doesn’t mean it’s no longer an effective method.In  this  section, we’ll analyze trends in email marketing, like subscription experiences, inbox functionalities, deliverability,    email design, code possibilities, the panorama of technology providers and much more. </p
											
											<h2>#Trend30. Content Modules and Targeting Model</h2>
											
											<p>Cross-Media Channel: The emergence of tools such as Facebook Custom Audience or Google Customer Match (although it has limitations) allow us to reach more consumers through different channels and develop a more sophisticated view of our audiences. Twitter and LinkedIn also allow you to create this type of audience. Thanks to the expansion of these new services, incomplete customer profiles will gradually become something of the past.</p>
											
											<p>Machine  Learning  and  Deliverability:  In  order  to  offer  a  one-to-one  experience, today’s algorithms can help us identify what content to offer to  each  of  our  contacts  and  when.  Now  that  we  have  more  information  than ever, we can apply and optimize static models that incorporate cross-information  from  different  channels,  both  email  and  behavior  on  the  destination site. So we can deliver content that implies that we know the expectations of the user, showing content and new products that you like. </p>
											
											<p>Visibility: Tools, such as Tableau, allow us to visualize information in new ways. They take advantage of the emergence of intelligence platforms for cloud-based companies and allow you to add data that comes from multiple sources.  So we can see which channels or media are impacting more on the performance of a specific email and detect opportunities to optimize the content and the medium. In addition, going one step further, we can improve the sophistication of the tools at our disposal, with the challenge of improving the approval processes of final creatives. Encouraging the end  customer  to  approve  the  content  by  modules,  and  not  a  complete  creativity, and focusing on new models of targeting, rather than audience segmentation.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trends31. Millennials  and  Big  Data  will  Shape  the  Future of Email</h2>
											
											<p>First,  millennials  and  their  real-time  use  of  communications  will  greatly  influence the frequency of email, making them more functional in real-time. This new generational audience will encourage reduced response times and will consume messages faster in the form of content.</p>
											
											<p>Second, the use of Big Data to create emails will be increasingly extended. This is due to the influence of millennials, who are not as hesitant as previous generations in allowing their private data be used to improve their experience  with  brands.  Communication  expectations  are  more  aligned  with the expectations of the digital experience. Source: Ryan Phelan, Vice President of Marketing Insights Adestra</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend32. The New Generation of Email Automation: Focusing on Content</h2>
											
											<p>In  the  past,  automation  used  to  be  very  time  focused.  Email  automationshould not only revolve around time, but also on the delivery of the correct content.</p>
											
											<p>In  2020,  email  automation  will  be  focused  on  content.  Emails  should  be  customized on a large scale using artificial intelligence to trigger emails. An example includes highly personalized texts, such as using AI elements to write the subject individually in each email of the campaign.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend33. In-Email Purchases</h2>
											
											<p>Marketers  specialized  in  email  marketing  believe  it  will  be  possible  for  personalized shopping experiences to become a reality, based on the habits and preferences of each subscriber in your database. </p>
											
											<p>In  fact,  we  think  that  the  ability  to  make  purchases  directly  from  email  is  closer  to  becoming  a  reality.  The  same  way  many  social  networks  have  integrated shopping options within their platforms, email will soon be able to host purchases without having to leave the format.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend34. SVOC (single view of the customer) and IoT Related Email Challenges</h2>
											
											<p>1. Emails will be used for warning messages and will be part of the Internet of Things landscape. Think of emails that will alert you when someone starts up your car or enters the house.</p>
											
											<p>2. New metrics will emerge from this new IoT reality and will become important in reports.</p>
											
											<p>3. Less than 15% of emails are read on a computer. We must keep in mind that notifications may  be  received  on  different  types  of  devices:  tablet,  mobile,  among others.</p>
											
											<p>4. Apart from creating a textual version of the warning email, we must create “short messages” that adapt to devices that go beyond mobile phones, such as wearables.</p>
											
											<p>5.  Consumer  interactions  that  occur  through  an  email,  branded  app,  or  the  device that generates the message (such as your fridge) can lead the user to a website. </p>
											
											<p>6. Creating an email message will be easier, using for example HTML code.</p>
											
											<p>7. The  HTML  text  and  subject  can  have  the  ability  to  change,  even  after  sending the email.</p>
											
											<p>8. Online purchases can be made directly from an email, using the fingerprint readers on our devices.</p>
											
											<p>9.  Inboxes  will  rearrange  promotional  emails,  depending  on  our  interest, making it easier to find a promotion to redeem in the store.</p>
											
											<p>10. You can reply and read messages from your email using voice commands.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend35. CTA and Subject: The Most Important Part of the Email</h2>
											
											<p>Consumers  are  increasingly  reading  emails  more  and  more  from  their  phones.  These  small  screens  have  changed  the  way  we  read,  and  now  marketers must redesign the emails they send. In 2020 messages should be short and feature a prominent call-to-action and engaging subject line.</p>
											
											<h2>Trends in PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING</h2>
											
											<h2>#Trend36. Investment Growth for 2020 and 2021</h2>
											
											<p>According  to  research  conducted  by  eMarkters,  more  than  86.3%  of  the  advertising   investment   in   the   United   States   will   be   purchased   using   programmatic technologies by 2020, which will cost $70 billion. By 2021, it will represent 87.5% and come with an investment of $81 billion.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trends37. Customized Programmatic Advertising</h2>
											
											<p>Programmatic customization is booming, allowing advertisers to improve performance  and  make  ads  more  relevant  with  personalized  messages.  With the help of Big Data, personalized programmatic advertising allows advertising creatives to dynamically change to be more relevant to users (with ad adaptation factors that include location, device type, demographics and time.) The main benefit of this technology is that it can generate feedback quickly, allowing marketing professionals to optimize in real time.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend38. The introduction of 5G</h2>
											
											<p>This  technology  recently  underwent  its  first  phase  of  commercial deployment. This means that devices prepared for 5G can benefit from speeds of 1000Mpbs, 10 times more than 4G. This high bandwidth allows advertising  technology  ecosystems  to  load  ads  faster,  which  avoids  millisecond delays that generally cause users to leave a website. Therefore, the  rise  of  video  provides  the  opportunity  for  the  world  of  programmatic  advertising to deliver higher resolution ads to its target audience.</p>
											
											<p>This  a  great  opportunity  for  the  future  of  programmatic  buying.  It  is  estimated that in 2025 there will be approximately 1.1 billion 5G connections. With faster transactions, this expedites the way in which ads are presented to consumers.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend39.  New  Metrics  for  Programmatic  Video  Advertising</h2>
											
											<p>Brands  can  measure  the  performance  of  their  programmatic  television  campaigns using traditional metrics. But brands with a vision of the future should complement their reports with more modern metrics, such as cost per view, to attribute the increase in brand and performance to OTT (over-the-top) advertising and connected television (Connected TV or CTV).</p>
											
											<p>The traditional way of measuring performance is with audimeters, a device that offers figures on the programs being watched in each house and which programs do or don’t continue on the grid.</p>
											
											<p>This system has always caused controversy, because it’s not very accurate. There are very few audimeters in all of Spain (4,755 in total) and the panelists (their owners) are obliged to keep it secret so that a manager of a chain or a program cannot “buy them”. The system’s reliability can be questioned due to several questions; Who chooses the panelists? Where do they go? How do they report their presence on the other side of the screen?</p>
											
											<p>Hence, the new metrics offered by the digital environment help us to clarify results and their impact.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend40. Connected TV</h2>
											
											<p>Connected TV is an opportunity to develop new business models that break the glass ceiling of advertising investment revenue stake in the traditional television  systems.  The  growing  use  of  automation  and  big  data  allows  connected  TV  to  deliver  advertising  that  is  increasingly  tailored  to  the  viewer’s interests.</p>
											
											<p>Investment in TV programmatics will reach $4.73 billion in the United States by 2020. It is estimated that by the end of 2019 there will be nearly 196 million users with connected television and above 200 million in 2021, according to data from eMarketer.</p>
											
											<p>Attitudinal  and  behavioral  insights,  combined  with  predictive  models,  will make programmatic purchasing more agile and successful. In Spain, investment in connected TV (generally) reached 2.8 million euros, according to IAB Spain in 2018. Programmatic video buying accounts for 27.6%.</p>
											
											<p>In  Spain,  connected  television  is  growing  rapidly,  with  57%  of  users  with  smart TVs, according to The Cocktail Analysis. 62% have some subscription to streaming platforms like Netflix or HBO. In addition, there are almost 7 million pay-TV subscribers, according to the CNMC from 2018 data. By 2020, the distribution of connected TV is expected to double to 50 percent.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend41. Native Advertising Metrics</h2>
											
											<p>Where previously the same metrics from display advertising or email marketing were applied, more and more specific measurements for native advertising are being developed.</p>
											
											<p>It’s  also  understood  now  that  isolated  metrics  do  not  bring  much  value,  but  should always be taken into account in the context of the overall goals of the brand.</p>
											
											<p>In the native advertising and branded content environment, it makes sense to  focus  on  KPIs  that  are  related  to  engagement,  aka,  the  user’s  response  to  content. Depending on the media used, we can distinguish between two major types of engagement: social engagement and web engagement.</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Social  Engagement:  Getting  the  public  hooked  on  your  social  media  community is a very valuable asset to a brand. It includes optimizing and increasing interactions, strengthening the brand-follower relationship, increasing brand visibility, and strengthening trust. Interactions can be likes, comments, retweets, etc.</li>
												
                                                <li>Web  Engagement:  These  are  the  interactions  around  your  brand,  but on your website. It may be a little more difficult to measure web engagement,  but  Grdar  proposes  to  differentiate  between  micro-interactions (downloadable PDFs interactions, newsletter subscription, filling  out  a  form,  blog  comments,  etc.)  and  macro  interactions (transactions) and then average from the users habits.</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend42. Native Advertising Formats</h2>
											
											<p>Native advertising and branded content support a wide variety of formats and locations, but until now it was difficult to establish rigid ratings. IAB USA has tried to classify the most classic and the newest formats into 6 types of ad units, which are as follows:</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>In-Feed ads: Facebook, Forbes, Twitter, etc.</li>
                                                <li>Paid Search Ads: Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.</li>
												<li>3. Recommendation Widgets: Disqus, Gravity, Outbrain, etc.</li>
												<li>4. Promotional Lists: Amazon, Etsy, Foursquare, Google, etc.</li>
												<li>5. Ads with native elements, served by their own means through their CMS or thier advertising server.</li>
												<li>6. Custom   Formats,   which   cannot   be   framed   in   the   5   previous   categories.</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<p>We’re excited to see how these concepts will extend throughout 2020.</p>
											
											<p>#Trend43.  Increased  Investment  in  Native  Advertising  and Branded Content</p>
											
											<p>In Europe its estimated that the revenue for native advertising will grow 35%, from 9.8€ billion in 2018 to 13.2€ billion in 2020, representing52% of the display revenue. By comparison, branded content should grow from €1.5 billion to €2.1 billion  during  this  period,  considering  only  the  average  paid  portion.  As  for  all  owned  average  -  which  tends  to  account  for  most  of  the  investments  in  Branded Content so far - similar growth is expected.</p>
											
											<p>The latest estimates of Native Advertising growth in the US forecasts a revenue of nearly 32€ billion in 2021. Native Advertising will reach 74% of total display billing. Although The European figures represent less than half of the US market, growth factors in both regions are very similar.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend44. Branded Content with Influencers</h2>
											
											<p>Branded content with influencers has a new twist and will once again be one of the most outstanding trends of 2020. Why? Influencers will now be the direct creators of the brand’s content, rather than just one more means of launching their advertising messages. For example, Instagram now allows influencers the option to transform their account into a “Creators” account, and which can give permissions to brands so that the brand can promote the influencer’s content, although the influencer still owns the post.</p>
											
											<p>Segmentation is important when choosing an influencer as they cannot only work with very broad categories, such as lifestyle.</p>
											
											<p>Collaborations must be organic. In this sense, the content must be adapted according  to  the  product,  target,  characteristics,  as  well  as  giving  some  creative freedom to the influencers, so that they themselves offer credible content. You need to listen to them, as they know their audience very well and the content they like.</p>
											
											<p>The branded content that comes from the influencer’s channel must be differentiated from the branded content where an influencer appears on the brand’s own channels.</p>
											
											<h2>Trends in Content Marketing</h2>
											
											<strong>Content Marketing</strong>
											
											<p>We’re looking forward to discovering what will happen in the near future with content marketing. It’s important to have a base knowledge of of this method brings value currently, and use that awareness to evolve this technique.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend45. Webinars Remain a Trend</h2>
									
											<p>Some have a very old-school view on webinar and believe that they are just a one-hour course in which someone gives a masterclass on a topic. But, we can go much further and find wonderful ideas to turn that idea of webinars around.</p>
											
											<p>DemandGen has found that 66% of users say they prefer webinars to another content format, as long as they are not always using the same tools in the same way.</p>
											
											<p>In order to make webinars more fresh, we have proposed some trends that we expect to see in 2020:</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Serializing webinars as if it were a series program</li>
                                                <li>Infusing your brand into the experience</li>
												<li>Being more interactive</li>
												<li>Offer content that makes it possible to contact your audienc</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend46. A Result from the Same Website by Search</h2>
											
											<p>With Google’s last big update in June 2019, users won’t be able to see more than two results from the same site in the top results in a single search. If more than two are displayed, it’s because Google’s system has determined that for that specific search it was interesting to show more options.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend47. Visual Storytelling</h2>
											
											<p>Visual storytelling has grown in popularity over the past few years. This means using tools such as graphics, images, infographics, gifs or videos. The purpose is to generate more engagement with the viewers, with the aim of making them feel  certain  emotions,  promoting  interaction  and  motivating  the  audience  towards the realization of an action.</p>
											
											<p>A person’s average attention span for ads is 8 seconds. When you use visual storytelling you should keep in mind that everything starts and ends with the idea of living an experience.</p>
											
											<strong>So ask yourself what do you want your audience to do:</strong>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Read something?</li>
                                                <li>Download something?</li>
												<li>Buy a product</li>
												<li>Sign up for your newsletter?</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend48. Using Technology to Explore Interests</h2>
											
											<p>Marketers do not produce content for the love of art. Instead, they create effective, high-quality advertising that is useful to the consumer. That’s why marketers need to generate, analyze, and use only high-value information that gives insight into the interests and needs of the audience. To do this in 2020, you will need to use the technology that can...</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Discover the capabilities of each technology (AI, neural connections, voice search, analysis of consumer feelings, etc.)</li>
                                                <li>Figure  out  what  you  need  at  the  technological  level  to  create  content (quick video generation, add 3D effects, augmented reality implementation in your ads, etc.)</li>
												<li>Analyze consumer reactions, because without that you won’t know how technology is helping you.</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend49. Content  Distribution: Social  Media  Wins by Far</h2>
											
											<p>Knowing the trends in content distribution and which technologies are being used is very important in B2C marketing, but also in B2B.</p>
											
											<p>Social media offers a lot of important information for understanding audiences, so it should come as no surprise that 85% of marketers are using a wide variety of tools and technologies that help us process all this information. Identifying and prioritizing KPIs is the first step, but the right tools are needed to analyze information, optimize content, and extract future improvements or trends.</p>
											
											<p>Email remains as one of the most used channels, with 75% of professionals in the sector having it as a tool and usual software. Email automation is essential for  personalization,  segmentation  and  at  the  same  time  the  success  of  this  channel.  For  example,  75%  of  consumers  prefer  to  open  emails  from  well-targeted campaigns than to those that don’t.</p>
											
											<strong>The most popular tools are as followed:</strong>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Analysis Tools (71%)</li>
                                                <li>Creation And Content Optimization Tools (55%)</li>
												<li>Cms or Content Management Systems (52%)</li>
												<li>Workflows or Editorial Calendars (45%)</li>
												<li>Marketing Automation Systems (29%)</li>
												<li>Chatbots (12%)</li>
												<li>Cmp or Integrated Content Marketing Platform (12%)</li>
												<li>Artificial Intelligence (4%)</li>
												<li>Tools to Promote Content (27%)</li>

                                            </ul>
											
											<h2>#Trend50. Growth in Content Marketing Investment</h2>
											
											<p>57%  of  marketers  who  specialize  in  content  creation  say  they  have  seen  their brand budget increase for this type of format.</p>
											
											<p>29% of brands have increased their investment from 1%-9% to 9%-28%.</p>
											
											<p>29% say they have stayed the same. The truth is that this data is very positive and confirms the good health of a strong content marketing strategy.</p>
											
											<h2>Trends in Inbound Marketing</h2>
											
											<strong>Inbound Marketing</strong>
											
											<p>When the term “inbound marketing” first emerged in 2005, the way we used the internet was very different. It is logical, therefore, that this methodology has evolved and continues to grow.</p>
											
											<p>On the surface, 2020 inbound marketing may look little like 2005, but both share the same spirit: attracting users to our brand organically and accompanying them on the road to becoming loyal customers. Let’s take a look at the latest inbound  trends  so  that  you  continue  to  succeed  with  this  methodology  for  years to come.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend51. Chats and Messages</h2>
											
											<p>Direct  messaging  apps  such  as  WhatsApp  or  Facebook  Messenger  have  changed the way we communicate in recent years. And now, this revolution is coming to inbound marketing.</p>
											
											<p>According to Hubspot data, the willingness of users to be contacted by such applications varies  greatly  by  region.  Globally,  49%  of  users  would  agree  to  communicate with brands through Facebook Messenger, but this percentage drops to 26% in Germany and rises to 73% in Latin America. On the other hand, WhatsApp enjoys 46% acceptance globally, but this figure is only 11% among Americans and no less than 83% among Latin Americans.</p>
											
											<p>In a step towards this trend, Hubspot now allows you to manage the Facebook Messenger  bot  from  their  platform.  For  marketers,  these  applications  offer  very interesting possibilities in the field of customer service and marketing automation. It’s time to experiment!</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend52. Video Marketing</h2>
											
											<p>Yes,  video  is  still  trending  in  inbound  marketing  in  2020.  Although  this  format is nothing new, the figures show that its popularity continues:</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>85% of all internet users in the United States watched at least one video content a month through one of their mobile devices. (Statista, 2018)</li>
                                                <li>54% of consumers want to watch more video content related to the brands or companies that they follow. (Hubspot, 2018)</li>
												<li>87% of marketing professionals use video as a tool in their strategy. (Wyzowl, 2019)</li>
												<li>Videos are what users want to see on brand’s social media the most. (Animoto, 2018)</li>
												<li>8% of marketing professionals are happy with the ROI of their videos on social networks. (Animoto, 2018)</li>
												<li>Video marketers get 66% more qualified leads per year. That means that  video  marketing  is  a  high-interest  lead  generation  channel.  (Optionmonster, 2019)</li>
												<li>Users  spend  88%  more  time  on  a  website  if  they  have  embedded  video content than one that doesn’t. (Forbes, 2018)</li>
												<li>If on the same page, consumers have video and text to learn more about a product or service, 72% prefer the audiovisual option. (Wyzowl, 2018)</li>
												<li>Video  captivates  more  than  text.  95%  of  the  audience  is  more  receptive  to  remembering  a  call-to-action  if  they  saw  it  on  video,  compared to 10% by reading it. (Forbes, 2017)</li>
                                            </ul>
											
											<p>With improved smartphone cameras and increasingly popular formats such as live video, which requires no editing, this format is more accessible than ever for brands of all sizes.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend53. YouTube Cards for Lead Acquisition</h2>
											
											<p>YouTube’s “i” button allows you to capture leads in a very simple way. This icon appears at the top right of the videos.You can use this tool to add text as well as a menu with visual or graphic links (known as YouTube Cards) that will be accessed by those users who click.</p>
											
											<p>To generate desired leads you can make your Card point to your downloadable content section (courses, ebooks, packs of “do it yourself”, etc.)You can also use other strategic points on your YouTube channel to attract and convert, like the final screen of the video, the description (where you can put links) or the video itself. Have the person in the video encourage viewers with a CTA.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend53. From Conversion Funnel to Conversion Cycle</h2>
											
											<p>The diagram of the conversion funnel has accompanied marketers for many years,  and  has  guided  many  of  their  strategies,  but  we  think  it’s  time  for  a  change. In 2018, Hubspot surprised the inbound marketing community when they proposed changing the conversion funnel into the conversion flywheel, a moving cycle that covers the following phases:</p>
											
											<ul>
                                                <li>Attract: Create content and conversations that generate a relationship with your audience.</li>
                                                <li>Convert:  Build  lasting  relationships  with  customers  by  providing  valuable  information  and  solutions  aligned  with  their  obstacles  and  goals.</li>
												<li>Delight: Provide an extraordinary experience that adds real value and encourages clients to become ambassadors for your brand</li>
												
											</ul>

											<p>While a funnel loses energy as it progresses, the energy on a flywheel is efficiently recycled. Thus, the customers you have already gained indirectly help you generate new sales and the process starts again.</p>

											<p>The  conversion  cycle  isn’t  a  new  concept.  It  was  invented  in  1993  by  Don  Peppers and Martha Rogers, the creators of 1-to-1 marketing. But this old school method has a new life in 2020: we expect to see more companies using this method to incorporate all areas of marketing, sales, and services as a whole</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend54. Public Relations in Inbound Marketing</h2>
											
											<p>Public relations can sometimes get a wrap for being old fashioned, but it is actually one of our top trends for 2020. This tactic is based on cultivating the brand’s relationship with the media and getting them to talk about the brand organically, without having to pay for sponsored content. A modern public relations strategy can have many advantages for a brand: more visibility and  engagement,  positioning  the  brand  as  an  expert  in  their  sector,  and  increasing leads.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend55. Natural Language Processing</h2>
											
											<p>Natural language processing is an area of artificial intelligence that keeps moving  forward  and  has  multiple  applications  for  marketers,  so  it’s  not  surprising that its among one of 2020’s top trends.</p>
											
											<p>Next-generation  language  processing  systems  can  distinguish  between  passing mentions of a brand and those that have an actual purchase intent,and offer the brand a list of potentially interested customers.</p>
											
											<p>Another high-potential application of natural language processing is creating content for inbound marketing. Although computers are not ready to replace a human editor at the moment, in the coming years we expect to see interesting developments  in  this  area.  However,  there  are  companies  that  are  starting  to dabble in artificial intelligence and using data to create new content from previously published content. The idea is that, through the platform, you can include several links from different sources that you want to use, and then the platform makes new written, visual or video content. </p>
											
											<h2>#Trend56. A/B Testing in SEO</h2>
											
											<p>One of the keys to success in digital marketing is testing different ways to do things, and SEO is not an exception.</p>
											
											<p>SEOA/B  testing  allows  you  to  isolate  variables  that  actually  work  when  it comes to attracting traffic. With this information, it is possible to make structured  changes  to  existing  content  to  improve  the  positioning  of  a  page  with  relatively  little  effort.  To  detect  areas  of  improvement,  our  recommendation is that you start by looking at the pages on your website that attract a lot of impressions but a low click-through rate.</p>
											
											<p>You can try launching a page with two different titles and meta descriptions and see which one works best when it comes to attracting users in SERPs.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend57. The Rise of Podcasting Content</h2>
											
											<p>Podcasts are a booming trend for 2020. According to data from Statista and Business  Insider,  Spain,  the  United  States,  and  the  United  Kingdom  have  some of the highest podcast listeners (at 40%, 33%, and 18% respectively). Even more revealing, 65% of listeners surveyed in Encuesta Pod 2019 listen to traditional live or on-demand radio today. Another highlight is that the average podcast user prefers a duration between 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
											
											<p>Additionally,  podcast  listeners  are  very  loyal.  79%  of  Encuesta  Pod  2019  respondents said they listen to 90% of the episodes of the shows that they’re subscribed to.</p>
											
											<p>The  most  interesting  information  for  marketers  is  that  40%  of  listeners  claim they are willing to listen to ads while listening to an episode. In short, podcasts are a great opportunity to inject brands into the day-to-day lives of their target audience, offer interesting content, and generate community and loyalty.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend58. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2>
											
											<p>Artificial  intelligence  has  the  potential  to  alter  virtually  every  aspect  of inbound marketing by 2020 and beyond, from intelligent content curation to segmentation and analytics.</p>
											
											<p>If correctly implemented, artificial intelligence can help optimize creativity, distribution, and analytics and fine-tune marketing initiatives to help create faster, better, and highly segmented marketing strategies</p>
											
											<p>But despite its potential benefits, artificial intelligence still faces challenges such  as  consumer  suspicion.  In  general,  users  want  to  receive  familiar,  personalized treatment, and if they feel like they’re  “talking to a machine” they can feel rejection and resentment. That’s why marketers should start with a strategy to change customer’s perceptions of AI before including it in their marketing plans.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend59. Automation and Email Marketing</h2>
											
											<p>According to a recent Forbes article, “email is not dead, it is evolving.” This statement perfectly sums up the current state of email marketing.</p>
											
											<p>A Hubspot  study  revealed  that  consumers  don’t  mind  receiving  emails  frequently,   as   long   as   they’re   relevant   to   their   needs.   But,   sending   personalized  and  relevant  communications  can  be  a  challenge  when  managing a large database. The solution? Marketing automation.</p>
											
											<p>With a well-configured marketing automation platform, it is possible to activate email flows in response to specific events, thus increasing the emails’ relevance to users. It’s not about putting all campaigns on autopilot, but about using technology intelligently to suit users’ needs at all times.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend60. Big Data</h2>
											
											<p>We’ve been talking about big data for years, and as time goes on this technol-ogy has become more accessible and relevant. We are increasingly in need of better capabilities to both analyze available data and put use it for inbound marketing campaigns.</p>
											
											<p>According to Nick Worth, Chief Storyteller at Selligent, big data reveals pat-terns, trends, and associations around user interactions. Simply put, it allows marketers to better understand what consumers are looking for and how they  behave.  Then  they  can  use  this  knowledge  to  give  consumers  what  they truly need in order to improve their experience and increase loyalty to the brand.</p>
											
											<h2>Trends in SEO</h2>
											
											<strong>SEO</strong>
											
											<p>SEO is constantly changing due to adjustments in search engine algorithms. Google has had a dizzying evolution in recent years, and its changes now occur at  such  a  rate  that  marketers  have  to  constantly  be  on  guard.  Updates  and  improvements in search results have grown exponentially, causing positions to increase and decrease, thanks to the continued volatility of SERPs.So take note on what’s to come in the world of SEO.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend61. SEO RankBrain</h2>
											
											<p>Google’s algorithmic capacity has multiplied thanks to the interpretation of more  than  30%  of  searches  through  “neural  matching”,  a  method  based  on  artificial intelligence. Google can now recognize the “human” concepts behind keywords thanks to RankBrain, and we have to take this development seriously when it comes to assessing what SEO trends will look like in 2020.So, what exactly is RankBrain? It refers to the name Google gives to the machine learning and artificial intelligence system it uses to help process its search results. Essentially is a machine that teaches itself how to do something.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend62. Chatbots in SEO</h2>
											
											<p>Chatbots solve doubts and provide information much more effectively and economically than people.</p>
											
											<p>But there’s more: the effective use of chatbots allows companies to collect feedback and information about frequently asked questions and behavior patterns, which we can then use to create relevant content that is of real interest to a potential target</p>
											
											<p>At Smartketing 2019, Pau Alpuente, CEO of Elabs Consulting, highlighted how chatbots are increasing the time spent on a page, directly and substantially improving positioning. It’s safe to say that inserting a chatbot in your website will increase one of the decisive metrics that Google analyzes, increasing your chance of having a good ranking.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend63. Local SEO is Synonymous with Voice Search</h2>
											
											<p>Everything  local  is  synonymous  with  voice  searches.  They  are  50%  of  the  queries that are made daily. Tools like Moz Local or Yext can help you manage your local presence.</p>
											
											<p>If  you  ask  your  voice  assistant  “Which  hospital  is  the  best  in  San  Diego?”  Google  will  read  the  name  of  the  hospital  that  is  the  highest  in  your  local  positioning, and take into account the reviews for this location and whether it has successfully completed their profile in Google Business. Ensure your content  marketing  is  written  very  well  along  this  line  so  as  not  to  miss  the  voice searches train.</p>
											
											<H2>Trends in SEM</h2>
											
											<strong>SEM AND GOOGLE ADS</strong>
											
											<p>Google Ads is where most of the world’s investing dollars go, within the digital advertising world. The reason why is very clear: searches make most of their searches in this search engine, giving marketers clues to their needs and who is  their  potential  target  is.  For  example,  Booking.com  acknowledged  that  it  invested $1.19  billion  in  marketing  performance  during  the  second  quarter  of  2019, with the majority of this budget item going to Google Ads.</p>
											
											<h2>#64. Google Ads Smart Bidding</h2>
											
											<p>Smart  Bidding  is  a  subset  of  automated  bid  strategies  that  use  machine  learning  to  get  more  conversions  or  improve  the  conversion  value  for  each  auction; a feature known as “bids at auction time.” The different types of Smart Bidding strategy include Target Cost-per-Acquisition (CPA), Target Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), Maximize Conversions, and Enhanced Cost Per Click (CPCm).</p>
											
											<p>Smart Bidding offers four key benefits to save time and improve performance:</p>
											
											<ul>
											
											<li>Advanced machine learning. Machine learning algorithms base bidding on large-scale data. This way, you can make more reliable predictions about  how  different  bid  amounts  would  affect  conversions  or  their  value.</li>
											
											<li>Wide variety of contextual signals. By defining bids at auction time, you can optimize them with a wide variety of signals in mind. Signals are identifiable attributes of a user or their context at the time of a particular auction.</li>
											
											<li>Flexible  performance  controls.  With  Smart  Bidding  you  can  set  performance goals and customize settings to your own business goals.</li>
											
											<li>Transparent performance reports. Smart Bidding includes reporting tools to help you get more valuable and detailed information about bid performance and resolve any issues quickly.</li>
											
											</ul>
											
											<p>Google has normalized the use of machine learning to optimize and automate bids, all at the same time. Thus, advertisers or marketers will be able to have new tools that will help us maximize conversions.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend65. Everything Has Migrated to the Mobile</h2>
											
											<p>Statistics tell us that mobile internet use has grown from 48.8% in 2014 to 63.4% in  2019.  With  growing  IoT  technologies,  people  will  be  able  to  access  more  sources of information. Smartphones are now more desired than laptops or computers. That’s why professionals predict that the ratio of mobile users will continue to grow and this will affect SEM in the coming years.Not to mention, Google sinks your search results if your page isn’t responsive and adapts to mobile formats.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trebd66. Audience Targeting</h2>
											
											<p>You can add audience targeting to ad groups to reach users based on who they are, what their interests and habits are, what they’re looking for, or how they’ve interacted with your business. This feature can improve the performance of your  campaigns  by  reaching  users  while  browsing  websites,  using  apps,  or  watching videos.</p>
											
											<p>Depending on the different types of campaigns, you can use different audience targeting:</p>
											
											<strong>Display</strong>
											
											<ul>
											<li>Custom audience based on intent or intent to purchase.</li>
											<li>Remarketing audience.</li>
											<li>Similar audiences.</li>
											</ul>
											
											<strong>Busqueda</strong>
											
											<ul>
											<li>Purchase intent audience</li>
											<li>Remarketing audience.</li>
											<li>Segmentation by customer list.</li>
											<li>Similar audiences.</li>
											</ul>
											
											<strong>Video</strong>
											
											<ul>
											<li>Custom audience based on intent.</li>
											<li>Remarketing audience.</li>
											<li>Segmentation by customer list.</li>
											<li>Similar audiences.</li>
											</ul>
											
											<strong>Hotel</strong>
											
											<ul>
											<li>Remarketing audience.</li>
											</ul>
											
											<p>One of Google’s latest updates already allows layered audiences, placed on top of each other. This means that keyword and demographic targeting can be used together to create extremely relevant ads.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend67. Bing Joins Visual Search</h2>
											
											<p>Visual searches are like text searches in any search engine, but based on uploading an image and then being given a recommendation for the same or similar. So, for example, if you take a photo of a vase you liked and do a visual search, the search engine will offer you links that take you to products that you can buy and are along the same line as what you are looking for.</p>
											
											<p>Bing has now joined this new technology and offers image search directly in its shopping section. We expect that in 2020 it will become more normal to per-form these kinds of searches when we want to find or buy something and we only have an image. Pinterest and Instagram recently launched similar tools and Amazon has just teamed up with Snapchat to add more value to visual searches.</p>
											
											<h2>#Treend68. Amazon’s Increase in Paid Advertising</h2>
											
											<p>While  Google  and  Facebook  bask  in  the  spotlight  in  the  paid  advertising  industry, Amazon has not been far behind. It is now the third most popular paid advertising platform, and forecasters are saying it will be one to watch in the coming years, so let’s see who takes the throne in 2020.</p>
											
											<p>Advertisers are starting to understand the appeal of advertising on Amazon. Shoppers who are on the site have a clear intention to buy, a fact that does not exist on Facebook or Google. Your users are there to  search for information. This detail gives Amazon a huge advantage. It’s no surprise that Amazon’s conversion rate is much higher than Google’s or Facebook’s.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend98. PPC Automation</h2>
											
											<p>Pay-per-click  automation  has  become  a  powerful  way  to  improve  the  performance  of  our  campaigns.  Companies  like  Google  have  invested  big  budget items in R+D to create and improve their automation options.</p>
											
											<p>To  take  full  advantage  of  the  automation  of  the  PPC,  we  need  to  provide  algorithms  so  that  Google  can  learn  from  our  campaigns,  allowing  them  to  continuously improve the machines themselves. </p>
											
											<p>While automation does needs human oversight, it is essential for your brand because  it  helps  free  up  time  overall,  which  can  then  be  devoted  to  more  qualitative tasks.</p>
											
											<h2>Trends in Data & Analytics</h2>
											
											<strong>Data & Analytics</strong>
											
											<p>Big Data is transforming companies and organizations of all kinds. Infact, we’ve seen a huge and welcomed change in the data analytics field: marketers are now adapting analytics according to their needs, rather than trying to fit the data into traditional methods of analysis.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend69. Data Analysis Automation (Big Data Automation)</h2>
											
											<p>As  we’ve  mentioned  throughout  this  book,  automation  is  a  huge  trend.  So  much so, it is estimated that by 2020 more than 40% of data-driven tasks will be automated.</p>
											
											<p>As a result, productivity is expected to increase globally and non-specialized data scientists will be able to take better advantage of the available data.</p>
											
											<p>In addition, data automation will also be a great help for decision makers, who will be able to see a step further and contribute to the advancement of their companies with the right information.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend70. Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
											
											<p>By 2020, there will be more than 20 billion active Internet of Things devices. And, logically, the more connected devices, the more data is available for analysis.</p>
											
											<p>In large companies, where IoT devices are being incorporated into day-to-day operations, the corresponding technology is also being implemented to be able to analyze the large volume of generated data.</p>
											
											<p>The  result  is  that  we  will  see  many  more  analytics  solutions  specially  designed for devices with the Internet of Things, which will not only provide relevant data but also bring transparency around them.</p>
											
											<p>But this trend also has its downside; 75% of organizations will not be able to  reach  the  full  potential  of  the  Internet  of  Things  due  to  a  shortage  of  professionals in the field of data science.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend71. The Rise of Data as a Service</h2>
											
											<p>Up to 90% of large organizations are expected to generate some kind of revenue from  data  as  a  service  (DaaS)  by  2020.  Data  as  a  service  is  a  cloud-based  technology that enables customers to access digital files over the internet.</p>
											
											<p>In addition, because high-speed internet is easily accessible to most consumers, the service is available to a wider audience. The globalization of DaaS will also help bridge different departments of the same company by offering them the ability to share data easily and faster. And with that, we will also see an increase in productivity.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend72. The Growth of Augmented Analytics</h2>
											
											<p>The Big Data trend of augmented analytics is quickly becoming the dominant method for 2020. Augmented analytics have revolutionized the paradigm by combining machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to create a new way to create, develop, share, and consume analytics.</p>
											
											<p>Augmented analytics is defined by Gartner in its Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms document as “a paradigm that includes natural  and  narrative  language  queries,  augmented  data  preparation,  automated  advanced  analytics,  and  visual  data  discovery  capabilities.”  In that same document, they emphasize the importance that augmented analytics will have in 2020, acting as a driver of business intelligence, data science and machine learning.</p>
											
											<p>The  augmented  analytics  market  is  experiencing  a  time  of  great  growth,  with forecasts going from $8.4 billion globally in 2018 to $18.4 billion in 2023.</p>
											
											<p>The  advantages  of  this  technology  lie  in  the  ability  to  automate  many  functionalities, such as data preparation, analysis, and modeling. In addition, it is much easier to interact with the information that is generated.</p>
											
											<h2>#Trend73. Data Security and Privacy</h2>
											
											<p>In 2015, less than 10% of large companies were using backups and snapshots for more than just data recovery. But by 2020, Data Sci Awards expects that more than  30%  of  companies  will  use  these  tools  to  improve  security,  privacy  and  reliability.</p>
											
											<p>Many  companies  have  large  volumes  of  sensitive  personal  data  in  their  backups, even if they do not intend to use them. In 2018, 10% of organizations considered backups and personal data files to be their primary privacy risk; by 2020, this will be the main concern for 70%. Without a doubt, a big data trend to take into account when choosing products and solutions for the coming years.</p>
											
											<h2>Stay Ahead of Current Trends</h2>
											
											<p>If you are operating a business, it’s important to know about current marketing trends and be able to stay on top of where digital marketing is headed in the future.</p>
											
											<p>And just like Amazon, you can start personalizing your products, using social media to answer questions, and implement video marketing to gain trust and show your brand’s transparency. Remember, if you are handling any client data then transparency is critical. And there are plenty of marketing software systems that can streamline all your online activities and customer relationships.</p>
