											<p>There is so much more to being a great web designer than just having the necessary technical skills. Another key to success is keeping up to date with the latest web design and styles from online and beyond.</p>
											
											<p>Keeping your finger active gives you the option to be the first finder of emerging styles and design styles. This, in turn, can help you bring projects, whether yours or your clients, really packing a fist. Having a solid repository of web design tips to turn to when it's time to go to work can also help speed up your workflow.</p>
											
											<p>Even if you are a young maverick who prefers to go your own way rather than follow the herd, keeping up with the latest web design tips and trends has its benefits. Alternatively, it will make it easier to understand the needs and wants of your customers as they discuss their project idea and want to emulate something they have seen elsewhere.</p>
											
											<p>And if you want to be truly real, knowing the current trends will help you avoid those best web design tips and styles and create something of your own.</p>
											
											<p>So in this article, you will find a collection of useful web design tips that will help your WordPress website and client projects you are working on in 2021 to achieve success - whether you want to use them or ignore them in your real quest. And if you are having issues with your web design you can consult with Web Design Vancouver.</p>
 
											<h2>1. Use white space:</h2>
											
											<p>According to Crazy Egg, the white space around text and headlines increases user attention by 20%. White space can also make your website feel more open, clean, and modern and if branding goes hand in hand this can help you communicate that feeling to the user.</p>
											
											<p>If you are trying to find more content above the fold (above the visible part immediately without scrolling) having too much white space may enter some important details. The key is to find the balance between what is most important at the top link and circle that with a certain space to highlight the image and text.</p>
											
											<h3>2. Optimize your page speed:</h3>
											
											<p>One of the most frustrating experiences for web users is waiting for a page to load too long. With the advent of mobile devices, people are finding content around the world on many different platforms. While browsing online at Starbucks or while watching TV on their laptop, they expect the immediate effect of the content they want.</p>
											
											<p>When they do not find it, they often bump into it. Small page uploads are a distraction for the user and can be a source of frustration and often users just don’t have the waiting time.
											According to Section.io, an additional five seconds of page load time can increase your website's "hitting rate" by more than 20%. Oops.</p>
											
											<p>So, where do you come from here? Find your school. Google offers a free service where you can get information about your page speed. Google will give you suggestions on how to improve your mobile upload time and Desktop.</p>
											
											<p>To improve the speed of your page, first, click on all your images before uploading them to your website. The image file size is one of the leading causes of slow page speed - using websites like Compressor.io can help you dramatically speed up every webpage you have. 
											Learn more about reducing your website's bounce rate in this blog post.</p>
											
											<p>A good example of a fast load is the Barnes and Nobles. It doesn't matter what baggage your Barnes and Noble uploaded right away. To create an extra warning to load some important stuff first so you know the content is on track. See for yourself.</p>
											
											
											<h2>3. Use attractive calls to action:</h2>
											
											<p>Calls to Actions (CTAs) that are clearly marked with the action name enable the users of your website to easily navigate your site and find exactly what they are looking for in the area they expect to find.</p>
											
											<p>When designing buttons for your website you should consider color and color psychology. In a study conducted by Maxymiser, researchers were shocked to find that they had received an 11% increase in clicks on the page of Laura Ashley's website, by testing color variations and texting. Different colors evoke different messages. Think about the message you want to convey to the user (trust, knowledge, intelligence), and choose your colors wisely.</p>
											
											<p>The second thing you need to consider is the actual words you use for your keys. Words should include an action or action word that pleases the user to do something. The choice of the right words or the right motive is largely determined by the level of emotional recognition that motivates the word. No emotional contact means no action. So make your words bold, time-conscious and straightforward.</p>
											
											<p>A good example of the efficient use of phones for WUFOO. The entire company page is straightforward and uses buttons to encourage the user to go to the next step. At the end of the page, you will see the use of time-bound language such as "Register Now" and action-directed language such as "Get Started." These are active action words that motivate and guide the user to move forward.</p>
											
											<h2>4. Use hyperlink differentiation:</h2>
											
											<p>When you add a link to any page, it says you want the user to click there. Make sure links are easily identified with visual cues. Underlined text and various colored text will capture the reader's attention and inform him or her that this is a link to a click.</p>
											
											<p>In a study by Karyn Graves, she shows that the average web user sees blue text underlined as links and knows how to click on them. Exploiting users' expectations and what they already know about using the web is like success.</p>
											
											<p>When it comes to hyperlink splits, you don’t need to refresh the wheel. Sticking to a meeting can be your biggest partner here. An easy way to test how well your links work is to blur and remove color in the design and see the highlight.</p>
											
											<h2>5.Part key details with bullet points:</h2>
											
											<p>Bullet points will enable the user to quickly find all the information they need: benefits, solutions to their problem, and key product/service features - all in a short time. This will make your suggestions more attractive and enable your user to get all the information they need. Plus, you don't have to go the traditional route with a simple circle.</p>
											
											<p>With tons of cool icons out there, you can get creative with your character and help the reader continue with images that represent your point. Why is this? Because it forces you to separate the most important points that you are trying to make without getting caught up in words or details.</p>
											
											<p>One good example of an unusual character comes from One.org. On this page, they use icons as characters to highlight their accomplishments in an easy-to-read way. Also, note the white space around the characters that allows you to focus on each section.</p>
