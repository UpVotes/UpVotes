                                            <h1>Top 11 mobile application development trends in 2020</h1>

                                            <p>IoT is enriching the upcoming revolt in the segments of mobile applications in the digital platform era. The way agencies used to provide solutions for application development is diverging. In almost every category, as with mobile apps, IoT technologies are also evolving. Through offering technical improvements to existing mobile apps, IoT has helped several businesses offer outstanding customer experiences.</p>

                                            <p>Through IOT, tech experts have projected that they will become a more important player in the app development industry than they are at present.</p>

                                            <p>Bain predicts the combined markets of the Internet of Things (IoT) will grow to about $520B in 2021, more than double the $235B spent in 2017.</p>

                                            <h2>Here are the listed mobile app development trends to look for in 2020.</h2>

                                            <div class="img-wrap">
                                                <img class="lazy" data-src="/images/Blogs/AR-VR-has-just-started.png" alt="App Trend #1 - The era of AR/VR has just started!" style="display: inline-block;">
                                            </div>

                                            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is not a new technology. IoT apps are all around us, ranging from voice technology to smart speakers to connected technology. Approximately 3.6 billion connected devices were used every day in 2018. Adoption in 2019 will almost definitely continue to increase. </p>

                                            <p>The big news, however, is not so much the growing number of connected devices as it is the increasing opportunities for the mobile app.</p>

                                            <p>Since innovation has become popular, costs have decreased and energy and availability have increased. As a result, developers will find a wealth of IoT devices, such as Android Things (formerly known as Brillo), Azure IoT, and Kaa — a platform with an open-source version available.</p>

                                            <p>Though versatile connected devices such as the Apple Watch may never become as omnipresent as the smartphone, that acceptance makes them an ever more compelling target for developers. In Q4 of 2018, Apple Watch's sales rose by 50% and its nearest rival, Fitbit, sold 3.5 million units in Q3. </p>

                                            <p>The growth in business IoT investments was even more remarkable, with a recent survey showing that 45% of businesses were using software, while another 22% were preparing for next year.</p>

                                            <p>Developers are faced with obstacles. The market is still highly fragmented, and platforms like Apple Watch and Fitbit are tiny compared to iOS and Android growth. But in a highly competitive technology environment, IoT offers a lot of opportunities to developers willing to look for it.

                                            <div class="img-wrap">
                                                <img class="lazy" data-src="/images/Blogs/AI-machine-learning.png" alt="App Trend #2 - AI & machine learning" style="display: inline-block;">
                                            </div>

                                            <p>The words ' machine learning ' and ' artificial intelligence ' are well known to tech lovers these days. In the technology industry, there is increasing demand for machine learning and AI in the form of virtual assistants and chatbots. Even the estimates shown by the International Data Corporation are optimistic that the AI market will set another milestone by rising to $40 billion by the end of 2020.</p>

                                            <p>AI and machine learning have deeper rooted in the mobile apps we could have introduced. Siri and Alexa are strongest evidence that machine learning and artificial intelligence are a major component of and cannot be divided from mobile apps now.</p>

                                            <h2 id="section3">App Trend #3 - 5G Technology for Mobile App Developers</h2>

                                            <div class="img-wrap">
                                                <img class="lazy" data-src="/images/Blogs/Technology-for-Mobile-App-Developers.png" alt="App Trend #3 - 5G Technology for Mobile App Developers" style="display: inline-block;">
                                            </div>

                                            <p>The 5G technology will be the most popular app development trend for the year 2019. Technology is about to change connectivity forever for mobile app developers. Hundreds of app developers are taking 5G mobile technology into account to improve the usability of their applications in terms of data protection, acceleration, 3D gaming, augmented reality and add new features to their mobile application.</p>

                                            <p>Technology linked to these areas will be strongly influenced by 5G. That said, developers should continue to see more apps on their mobile app, as they will get better and faster top-of - the-line speeds than ever before.</p>

                                            <p>Apps including custom-made network slices and ultra-low network latency can help improve the usability and performance of your mobile app which goes beyond a slower internet network.</p>

                                            <p>AT&T, for example, recently launched the AT&T 5 G Innovation Project to continue producing and developing new user experiences for 5G technology. The program is designed to turn 5G ideas into experiences in life of mobile app developers.</p>

                                            <p>I always advise designing and testing their mobile applications using 5G maximum throughput. It is essential because technologies built primarily for places with strong Wi-Fi or mobile high-speed networks such as 5G work satisfactorily for users with limited bandwidth opportunities.</p>

                                            <p>The Internet of Things for the development of mobile apps has become a large industry that evolves over time. Mobile application developers can use this technology to build intuitive platforms for managing different non-IT equipment through devices.</p>

                                            <p>Nearly all giants of tech have started to develop IoT-friendly applications. The IoT spending is expected to reach $120 billion by 2020.</p>

                                            <p>Developers of IoT mobile apps need to pick a viable platform for app development. So what's the best strategy to be? I've compiled a few things here to support you with this:</p>

                                            <div class="img-wrap">
                                                <img class="lazy" data-src="/images/Blogs/Mobile-wallets–the-mobile-banking-game-changers.png" alt="App Trend #5 — Mobile wallets – the mobile banking game changers!" style="display: inline-block;">

                                            <p>There is no doubt about the fact that the demand for Mobile Payment solution app development is on rise, and with security being the top most concern among developers, the usage of mobile wallets is only going to increase in the year 2019.</p>

                                            <p>In fact, frictionless payment methods is what today’s customers love to see in the mobile apps that they use.</p>

                                            <p>So, in 2019, mobile wallets as well as payment gateway integration that offer highest level of secured encryption will become mainstream in all kinds of mobile apps.</p>
